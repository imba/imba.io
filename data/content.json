This release contains breaking changes in the bundler that need to be tested thoroughly before beta.\n\n* Use the latest version of esbuild\n\n    We are finally using the latest version of esbuild. All of our custom logic\n    for hashing, resolving and chunking is now done by esbuild instead.\n\n* Support path aliases from `[js|ts]config.json`\n\n    Now that we are using the latest version of esbuild we finally support [path aliases](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#path-mapping) declared in `[js|ts]config.json` files. This also works with assets, ie. declaring `\"icons/*\": [\"assets/svg/*\",\"assets/codicons/*]` in your tsconfig would allow `<svg src=\"icons/some-icon.svg\">` to work anywhere in your project.\n\n* Remove support for path aliases in `imbaconfig.json`\n\n    If you had declared path aliases in an `imbaconfig.json` these should be moved into a `[js|ts]config.json` instead.\n\n* Remove backwards compatible transforms from compiler itself.\n\n    Previously we included a bunch of logic for transforming conditional assignments like `??=`,`&&=`, and `||=` to support older browsers and node versions. Now we compile these statements as is and rely on esbuild to transform when needed.\n\n* Remove support for `?=` operator - use `??=` instead.\n\n* Drop commonjs target from compiler\n\n    The imba compiler will now always compile import/export statements natively\n    to import/export in javascript, and instead rely on esbuild to convert the output to cjs when needed.\n\n* Simplify output from `imba build`\n\n    The output of imba build is now possible to run directly through node (and soon Bun). We \n\n* Allow running html file directly with `imba some-entry.html`\n\n    This will spawn a dev-server for this html file and its referenced scripts and stylesheets.\n\n* Allow testing client-side scripts with `imba --web some-entry.imba`\n\n    This will spawn a dev-server, a html entrypoint and all that is needed to run a script in the browser.\n\n* Copy static assets over from `public` when building\n\n    If you have a `public` directory in your project, files from this will be copied over to the public folder of your output dir (default `dist`) when building.\n\n* Allow prefixing asset paths via `--base` option\n\n    Ie, when building for github pages you would run `imba build --base /my-repo-name -o docs index.html` to build your files and assets with the correct prefix, into the `docs/` folder of your project to adhere to github pages convetions.\n\n* Support loading workers following vite conventions\n\n    ```\n    import MyWorker from './some/script?worker'\n    import MySharedWorker from './some/script?sharedworker'\n    import url from './some/script?worker&url'\n    ```\n\n* Set node14.13.0 as the default minimum target when building for node.\n\n    This can be overridden by supplying your version of node through the `--node.target` option. Ie `imba build --node.target node12 my/script.imba`\n\n* Fixed regression in router that caused routed elements inside the root component to fail.\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.214\n\n* Treat routes ending with `/` as exact routes.\n\n    The `<div route='/'>` would previously match any path. You could define exact routes by including a `$` at the end of the route. This lead to a lot\n    of confusion. Now, any route that ends with a `/` will only match the exact path. Use `*` to bypass\n\n    ```imba\n    <div route='/'> # matches / _only_\n    <div route='/*'> # matches any path\n\n    <div route='/items'> # matches /items, /items/1 etc\n    <div route='/items/'> # matches /items only\n    ```\n\n* Only show first matching element if multiple siblings match a route.\n\n    ```imba\n    <div>\n        <div route='/items/new'>\n        <div route='/items/:id'> # if /items/new matched - this will not show\n        <div route='/'> # matches if url is exactly '/'\n        <div route='*'> # matches if none of the above matches\n    ```\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.213\n\n* Make `@event.emit('...')` on `<global/teleport>` dispath event inside their literal parent (fixes #693) \n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.210\n\n* Add number units for `minutes`, `hours`, and `days`\n\n* Fixed issue where identical nested selectors were incorrectly optimized away\n\n* Support `silent: true` option for `imba.autorun` to not call imba.commit\n\n* Fixed issue where @autorun methods threw error when element was re-mounted (#684)\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.209\n\n* Fixed bug with observables not unsubscribing correctly in certain cases\n\n* Expose `imba.reportObserved`, `imba.reportChanged` and `imba.createAtom` (still experimental)\n\n* Add `imba.hotkeys.addKeycodes(...)` (#677)\n\n* Made `@touch.hold(dur)=handler` trigger handler after duration without waiting for additioanl events (#664)\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.207\n\n* Don't try to implicitly return debugger statement\n\n* Improve compilation of `extend` statements for tooling\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.206\n\n* Disallow iterating over falsy values using `for in`\n\n* Compile literal bigints correctly\n\n* Minor improvements to type definitions\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.205\n\n* Support `for await ... of` syntax\n\n* Support tagged templates\n\n    Works like in plain js, but `{}` is still used for interpolation instead of `${}`.\n    \n    ```imba\n        import md from 'tag-markdown'\n        const html = md`## Welcome to {name}`\n    ```\n\n* Add internal `#__patch__(props)` method for class instances to update fields\n\n* Stop shimming top-level await (delegates responsibility to esbuild)\n\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.204\n\n* Fixed operator precedence for ternary expressions\n\n* Revert automatic `calc` wrapping for css values introduced in alpha 200\n\n    Introduced a lot of bugs and challenges related to `/` being a valid part of css values. `calc` will still be automatically be added around top-level parenthesis in css values, so `width:(100vw - 20px)` will still compile as `calc(100vw - 20px)`, but properties like `grid-column: 1 / 3` will now compile without calc again.\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.203\n\n* Fixed regression with negated breakpoint modifiers like `display@!600:none`\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.202\n\n* Fixed performance regression for tag trees introduced in alpha 191\n\n* Fixed compilation of css properties wrapped in parenthesis\n\n* Make unresolved decorators resolve to `imba.@decorator`\n\n    ```imba\n    class Order\n        @lazy get lines\n            ...\n    ```\n\n    If `@lazy` is not found in the file above, the compiler will essentially include \n    `import {@lazy} from 'imba` when compiling.\n\n* Introduced experimental state management decorators\n\n    A minimal set of decorators heavily inspired by MobX that allows you to mark classes \n    and objects as observable, and run code upon changes. This feature will be kept under \n    wraps until it has been battle-tested.\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.201\n\n* Fixed regression where css colors `rgb(0 0 0 / alpha)` would compile incorrectly\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.200\n\n* Allow `@hotkey('*')` to listen to all hotkey events\n\n    This is perfect for disabling all other hotkeys in certain contexts.\n\n    ```imba\n    tag ConfirmDialog\n        # when this dialog is mounted - all hotkey handlers preceding\n        # it in the dom tree will be blocked by the `*` listener\n        <self @hotkey('*').global>\n            <button @hotkey('esc')> \"Cancel\"\n            <button @hotkey('enter')> \"Ok\"\n    ```\n\n* Automatically wrap style expressions in `calc()`\n\n    ```imba\n    css div width: calc(100vw - 40px)\n    # can now be written as\n    css div width: 100vw - 40px\n    ```\n\n* Make bind=data.property work for textarea when value is `undefined`\n\n* Allow nested parentheticals in css calc\n\n* Fixed issue where removing class names using `el.flags.remove` would not work\n\n* Made `@touch.flag` support selector in second argument to match `@event.flag`\n\n* Allow second argument to `el.flags.incr(flag, dur = 0)`\n\n    With this argument you can automatically decrement the flag after a certain duration.\n\n* Allow negated style modifiers\n\n    ```imba\n    css div\n        @!hover o:0.5 # div:not(:hover) { opacity: 0.5 } \n        @!md d:none # @media (max-width: 767px) { div { display:none } }\n    # also works for classes\n    css div\n        @.!disabled o:0.5 # div:not(.disabled){ opacity:0.5 }\n    ```\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.199\n\n* Fix regression where content of `<teleport>` and `<global>` was not rendered (#643)\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.198\n\n* Change how css specificity is forced in generated selectors\n\n    Older browsers do not support complex selectors within `:not()`, so the style `:not(#_#_#_)` which is used for \"inline\" styles would not work in these browsers. We have now reverted to using multiple not selectors like `:not(#_):not(#_):not(#_)`. This is more verbose but the size is negligible, especially with compression. Debugging styles in the browser is a bit more clumsy.\n\n* Change css specificity for component rules\n\n    Selectors inside tag declarations are now compiled with a higher specificity than global selectors.\n\n    ```imba\n    tag App\n        # scoped selectors have higher precedence than global styles\n        css .selector d:block\n    ```\n\n* Fixed case where a generated class-name is added multiple times on elements\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.197\n\n* Fixed issue with bracketless multiline object and certain operators\n\n    ```imba\n    let x = null\n    x ||=\n        one: 1\n        two: 2\n    # would previously compile incorrectly to x ||= {one: 1}\n    ```\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.196\n\n* Introduced `@event.closest(sel)` modifier\n\n    Works like `@event.sel(selector)`, but checks for `target.closest(...)` instead of `target.matches(...)`.\n    In the cases where you want to just handle clicks that do _not_ match a selector you can negate the modifier using `.!closest(...)`.\n\n    ```imba\n    tag App\n        <self>\n            # all clicks outside of button tags\n            <div @click.!closest('button')>\n                <button> <span> \"Click\"\n                <p> \"blabla\"\n    ```\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.195\n\n* Fixed compilation issue for functional tags without arguments\n\n* Throw error when trying to use bind on functional tags\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.194\n\n* Improved syntax for functional tags\n\n    If you supply `()` after a tag name, Imba will now treat it as a functional tag. Ie, `<some-name(1,2)>` is equal to `<( some-name(1,2) )>`. The old syntax may be phased out before final release. \n\n    ```imba\n    def List items\n        return if items.length == 0\n\n        <section>\n            <slot>\n            <ul> for item in items\n                <li> item.title\n\n    tag App\n        def head\n            <header> <slot> <h2> \"Welcome\"\n\n        <self>\n            <head()>\n            <List(data.newest)> <h2> \"Newest posts\"\n            <List(data.all).large> <h2> \"All posts\"\n    ```\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.193\n\n* Fix issue where parts of runtime was incorrectly tree-shaked\n\n* Always resolve `node:*` imports as external\n\n* Include changelog.md in npm package\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.191\n\nThere will likely be a few more alpha releases fixing regressions and issues related to the new features in alpha 191, but after these potential issues have been resolved we're moving to beta 🥳! This release does contain a few breaking changes, both in relation to styles and memoization. We'll update the docs at imba.io and publish a screencast going over the changes to make it easier to transition to this new version. Changes;\n\n* Rename $key to key\n\n    To give elements a stable identity (usually inside lists) you should now use `<el key=value>` instead of `<el $key=value>`. `$key` is deprecated and will be removed in `beta.1`. \n\n* Allow using any object as `<element key=...>` value\n\n    Keyed elements now use a `Map` instead of a plain object to keep track of unique elements. This means that any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as keys.\n\n    ```imba\n    const items = [{title: \"One\"},{title: \"Two\"}]\n\n    tag App\n        <self> for item in items\n            # objects themselves can be used as keys now\n            <AppItem key=item data=item>\n    ```\n\n* New (improved) syntax for rendering functional components / tag trees\n\n    This was the main change holding us back from reaching beta, as it is a breaking change for most users. When you want to include external live dom elements from getters or methods outside of the render-tree, wrap the expression in `<(expression)>`.\n\n    Besides simplifying the way memoization works it also allows you to add classes and styles to these external fragments, making it vastly more flexible than before.\n\n    ```imba\n    tag App\n        get body\n            <div> \"This is body\"\n\n        def list title, items\n            <section>\n                <h2> title\n                <ul> for item in items\n                    <li> item.title\n\n        <self>\n            <( body )>\n            <( list 'Top', data.popular ).large [mt:2]>\n            <( list 'New', data.posts.slice(0,10) )>\n    ```\n\n* Log warnings to console when building/running without minification\n\n    Added runtime checks that notify about erroneous behaviour when building/running w/o minification. Initially it will only warn about non-memoized elements being created during rendering. Eventually we'll use these conventions to add much more elobrate checks and readable error messages for the most common issues users can run into.\n\n* Allow instantiating elements w/o memoization using `new`\n\n    Imba will automagically allow any element (literal tag) in any method to be memoized.\n\n    ```imba\n    def wrap text\n        let div = <div.item> text\n        return div\n\n    imba.mount do <section>\n        <( wrap \"One\" )>\n        <( wrap \"Two\" )>\n    ```\n\n    If you call a method or access a getter that returns an element (like `def wrap`) it will look up a memoization context and just reuse/update the div for that particular context. If you call it directly without being in a context, Imba will warn you. There are however some situations where you actually just want to create new elements. In this case, use `new` in front of the element. If the root is not memoized, the children won't either, so you only need to add `new` in front of the top element.\n\n    ```imba\n    def wrap text\n        let div = new <div.item> text\n        return div\n    ```\n\n* Allow non-global tag types in dynamic tag names\n\n    Local tag types are now allowed in `<{tag-type} ...>` syntax. Previously it would only work when `tag-type` evaluated to a string, and there was a globally defined web component or native tag with that name. Now it works with classes as well.\n\n    ```imba\n    import {PostView,ArticleView} from './views'\n\n    const items = [\n        { type: Post, title: \"My post\"}\n        { type: Article, title: \"My article\"}\n    ]\n\n    tag App\n        <self>\n            for item in items\n                <{item.type} data=item>\n    ```\n\n* Only allow named elements inside `<self>`\n\n    Using named elements (`<div$myname>`) outside of self would previously introduce subtle bugs and conflicts. They are now only allowed inside of `<self>`.\n\n* Changed css specificity\n\n    Styles declared in tag declaration body now has lower specificity than class selectors.\n\n    ```imba\n    css .warn hue:red\n    css .large p:4 fs:lg\n\n    tag Button\n        css p:2 fs:sm hue:blue\n    \n    # styles from classes take precedence\n    <Button.warn.large>\n    ```\n\n* Scoped selectors no longer applies to self\n\n    Now, selectors like `.warn` declared in tag declaration body only applies to elements _inside_ `Button`, not the button itself. To target the button itself, use `&` in the selector.\n\n    ```imba\n    tag Button\n        css bg:blue2\n        css .warn bg:red2\n        css &.large fs:lg\n\n        <self.warn.large> \"Still blue bg - but large\"\n    ```\n\n* Add `declare` keyword for declaring fields (with type annotations) without generating any code for that field\n\n    ```imba\n    class Foo\n        declare a\\number\n    ```\n\n* Allow multiline conditionals when lines start with `and`,`or`,`||`, or `&&`\n\n    This is a temporary solution for a larger challenge. It simply ignores new-lines whenever your line starts with these operators.\n\n    ```imba\n    if condition\n    and test\n    or force\n        return ...\n    ```\n\n* Allow third argument in `for in` loops referencing length\n\n    If you need to know the length of a collection you are iterating over, you can now access the total length of the collection by supplying a third argument. This is not available in `for of`, only `for in`.\n\n    ```imba\n    for member,index,len in list\n        # len refers to the length of the iterable list\n        if index == len - 1\n            yes # this is the last element\n    ```\n\n* Exposed `imba.hotkeys.humanize` for converting hotkey combos to readable shortcuts\n\n* Exposed `imba.hotkeys.htmlify` for converting hotkey combos to readable shortcuts as html\n\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.190\n\n* Fixed regression related to implicit parenthesis in tag trees\n\n* Renamed `@hotkey.capture` to `@hotkey.force`\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.189\n\n* Introduced `@hotkey.repeat` modifier\n\n    When a user presses a key and then keeps holding it, keydown/keypress\n    events will be generated every n milliseconds. For hotkeys you usually\n    only want to trigger once when the user press the combination.\n\n    If you want the handler to keep firing while user holds down the keys\n    you can now use the `.repeat` modifier:\n\n    ```imba\n    # will only toggle when pressing space, no matter how long you\n    # keep it pressed.\n    <div @hotkey('space')=togglePlayback>\n    # holding the right arrow will call fastForward repeatedly\n    <div @hotkey('right').repeat=fastForward>\n    ```\n\n* Changed rules for implicit parenthes / calling in tag trees\n\n    Indented code under a tag-tree will no longer be compiled as an invocation.\n\n    ```imba\n    <div> data.name\n        \"something\"\n    if data.name\n        \"something\"\n    ```\n\n    The code above would previously compile to div `data.name(\"something\")`. Now\n    indentation in tag trees will behave like they do in statements like if/for/while etc.\n    This fixes #630, so you can now add css blocks like this:\n\n    ```imba\n    <div> data.name\n        css d:block # style for the div\n    ```\n\n* Added `@first-child` and `@last-child` css modifiers\n\n    We already have `@first` and `@last` as shorter aliases, but since all other standard pseudo-selectors exist it makes sense to include the longer versions of these as well.\n\n* Fixed issue with nested loops in tag trees\n\n    It is now possible to use nested loops without wrapping the inner loops in a fragment.\n\n    ```imba\n    <div>\n        for item in data.items\n            for label in item.labels\n                <div> label\n    ```\n\n* Allow declaring variables and global tags with the same name\n\n    Global web components should not be registered as regular variables.\n    Previously the compiler would throw an error if `tag app` and `let app = ...`\n    were declared in the same file.\n\n* Allow optional chaining with dynamic keys - #638\n\n    ```imba\n    user..[key]\n    ```\n\n* Mark imported SVGs as @__PURE__\n\n    This allows efficient tree-shaking so that one can include all icons from a collection\n    and only bundle the ones that are used.\n\n    ```imba\n    import * as icons from 'imba-codicons'\n    \n    <svg src=icons.volume-up>\n    # you get completions and previews for all icons, but only volume-up\n    # will be bundled in your code now\n    ```\n\n* Don't round x,y in `@touch.reframe` and `@touch.fit` by default (#639)\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.187\n\n* Call `dehydrate` on compononents when rendering components from the server.\n\n* Updated type declarations.\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.186\n\n* Don't add html class name for named elements\n\n    Previously when naming an element like `<div$title> ...`, imba would automatically\n    add a `title` class name to the element. This can lead to confusing issues. If you\n    have used this undocumented behaviour previously you just need to add the class\n    yourself, like `<div$title.title>`.\n\n* Introduced `@mouse.mod` modifier\n\n    Since Mac and Windows/Linux use different keyboard modifiers for most standard actions\n    (ctrl+c,ctrl+s,ctrl+click) vs (⌘c,⌘s,⌘+click) etc, it makes sense to have an event\n    modifier that takes care of checking the platform. `@mouse.mod` will return true of\n    ⌘ is pressed on mac, and Ctrl is pressed on all other platforms.\n    \n    ```imba\n    <div @click.mod.stop=openInNewWindow @click=openHere>\n    ```\n    \n* Fixed bug in `@event.throttle` modifier\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.183\n\n- Remove unneeded class names on tags when building\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.182\n\n- Fixed issues with using event modifiers with external imba library\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.177\n\n- Added type declarations into typings/\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.176\n\n- Deprecated `@touch.moved-dir`\n    \n    The direction of the `@touch.moved` modifier can now be specified in the second argument of `@touch.moved` instead of as 6 separate modifiers. These are not used that often and it seems natural to keep inside a single modifier instead.\n    \n    ```imba\n    <div @touch.moved-left(4px)> # before\n    <div @touch.moved(4px,'left')> # after\n    ```\n\n- Renamed style property `tint` to `hue`\n    \n    Hue is a better name for the newly introduced `tint` style property.\n    \n    ```imba\n    # hue can be set to any named color from the imba color palette\n    <div[hue:orange]>\n        <h1[color:hue7]> # refer to a shade/tint of the aliased color\n    ```\n\n- Refactored event modifiers\n\n    Foundations to allow defining custom event modifiers down the road. Complex modifiers have access to the context in which it was called, including a state-object that is persisted across events etc. Documentation fo this will be in place before 2.0 final. As an example, a tiny `@keydown.f1` modifier for only passing through F1 can be defined like this:\n    \n    ```imba\n    extend class KeyboardEvent\n      \n      def @f1\n        return keyCode == 112\n    ```\n    \n- Changed behavior of `@event.throttle` modifier\n\n    `throttle` would previously fire once and suppress subsequent events for a certain duration (default 250ms). Now it will re-fire at the end of the throttling if there were any suppressed events during the initial throttle. For events like `@resize` and `@scroll` where you just want to limit how often they fire, the new behavior is much more useful.\n    \n    ```imba\n    # handler will be called immediately upon scrolling and keep emitting\n    # every 100ms until there are no more scroll events. \n    <div @scroll.throttle(100ms)=handler>\n    \n    # So, clicking this button twice will trigger once immediately,\n    # and then again after 1 second. Previously the second click would\n    # never trigger.\n    <div @click.throttle(1s)=handler>\n    ```\n    \n- Introduced `@event.cooldown` modifier\n\n    The old `throttle` was renamed to `cooldown`. Ie, if you want subsequent button clicks to be suppressed for `n` time (250ms default) you should now use `cooldown` instead of `throttle`.\n    \n    ```imba\n    # So, clicking this button twice will trigger once immediately, and\n    # the next click will be ignored as long as it happens less than a second later\n    <div @click.cooldown(1s)=handler>\n    ```\n\n- Allow negated event modifiers\n\n    Certain event modifiers are called guards, like `@keydown.enter`, `@click.self` etc. These are modifiers that essentially evaluate to true/false and decides whether to continue handling an event or not. `@click.self` would only trigger if the target of the event is the same as the element to which the `@click` is bound. Now you can include a `!` in front of any such event handler to only continue if the guard is false.\n    \n    Ie. `<div @click.!shift=...>` would only trigger if shiftKey is _not_ pressed.\n    \n    ```imba\n    #  Only call handler if shiftKey is NOT pressed\n    <div @click.!shift=handler>\n    \n    #  Only call handler if target does NOT match the selector\n    <div @click.!sel('.active')=handler>\n    ```\n  \n- Introduced `@mouse.left`, `@mouse.middle`, and `@mouse.right` modifiers\n    \n    Only trigger if the left,middle, or right mouse button is pressed. Works for all mouse and pointer events, as well as the custom `@touch` event.\n    \n     ```imba\n    #  Only call handler if the middle mouse button was pressed\n    <div @click.middle=handler>\n\n    #  Only start touch handling if the right mouse button was pressed\n    <div @touch.right=handler>\n    ```\n    \n- Introduced `@intersect.flag` modifier\n\n    The `flag` modifier now works differently for `@intersect` event. It will add a css class to the element when it is intersecting and remove it whenever it is not intersecting.\n    \n     ```imba\n    # the html class showing will be present on div\n    # whenever it is intersecting with the viewport\n    <div @intersect.flag('showing')>\n    ```\n\n- Introduced `@touch.end` modifier\n\n    The `end` guard breaks unless the touch is in its ending state.\n    \n    ```imba\n    # handler is only called at the end of the touch\n    <div @touch.end=handler>\n    # handler is only called at the end of the touch if pointer moved\n    <div @touch.moved.end=handler>\n    ```\n\n- Introduced `@touch.hold(dur=1000ms)` modifier\n    \n    The `hold` modifier allows you to require an element to be pressed for some time (default 1000ms) until it starts allow events to come through.\n  \n    ```imba\n    # handler is only called once the touch has been held for 1000ms\n    <div @touch.hold=handler>\n    # handler only called if ctrl was pressed and touch held for 250ms\n    <div @touch.ctrl.hold(250ms)=handler>\n    ```\n\n\n- Introduced `@touch.apply(target,xprop='x',yprop='y')` modifier\n\n    Like `@touch.sync` but just setting the x,y values on an object directly instead of adding to the previous values. \n    \n    ```imba\n    const obj = {}\n    # apply is essentially shorthand for setting properties:\n    <div @touch.apply(obj)>\n    <div @touch=(obj.x = e.x, obj.y = e.y)>\n    ```\n\n\n- Added `@event.key(keyOrCode)` modifier for keyboard events\n\n    KeyboardEvent.keyCode is deprecated but still useful in many cases. If you supply a number to the modifier it will stop handling if `keyCode` does not match this number.\n    \n    ```imba\n    # Only trigger if F1 is pressed (event.keyCode==112)\n    <div @keydown.key(112)=handler>\n    ```\n    \n    If you supply a string it will compare it against KeyboardEvent.key.\n    \n    ```imba\n    # Only trigger if PrintScreen is pressed (event.key=='PrintScreen')\n    <div @keydown.key('PrintScreen')=handler>\n    ```\n\n- Changed behavior of `@touch.moved` modifier\n\n    Now, if you add a `moved-left(threshold = 4px)` modifier, the event handling will be cancelled if the touch has moved more in any other direction (in this case up,down, or right) _before_ moving 4px left.\n    \n    ```imba\n    # If user moves more than 10px up/down before left/right\n    # the touch will not be handled\n    <div @touch.moved-x(10px)=draghandle>\n    ```\n\n- Improved behaviour of `@touch` and `@click` events\n\n    `@click` events on nested children of an element with a `@touch` handler would previously be prevented. This made `@touch` pretty challenging to use for things like dragging elements with buttons etc.\n    \n    Now `@click` events will be triggered unless the `@touch` handler has a `prevent` modifier, a `moved(-x|y|up|down)` modifier that has activated, or a `hold` modifier that has activated.\n    \n    ```imba\n    # button click is triggered onless touch is held more than 500ms\n    <li @touch.hold(500ms)=draghandle> <button @click=handle>\n    ```\n\n- Improved behaviour of `@touch` and scrolling on touch devices\n    Previously, scrolling (and clicking) would be disabled for any element with a `@touch` handler on iOS. Ie. if you added `@touch` to a custom slider, scrolling would not work if the user happened to touch down on the slider while flicking down the page.\n    \n    Scrolling is disabled by the `prevent` modifier, an activated `moved` modifier or activated `hold` modifier.\n    \n    ```imba\n    # Scrolling will now work fine when touching the div and flicking up/down.\n    # Only if the user holds still on the element for 500ms will scrolling and\n    # default behavior be prevented.\n    <div @touch.hold(500ms)=draghandler>\n    ```\n\n- Add support for additional file extensions in bundler (webm, weba, avi, mp3, mp4, m4a, mpeg, wav, ogg, ogv, oga, opus, bmp)\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.175\n- Fix: `@in` transitions for nested elements works\n- Experimental support for tweening from/to implicit width/height in transitions\n- Experimental `@resize.css` modifier to automatically enable size units\n- Allow variables in color opacity like `color:blue4/$alpha`\n- Experimental support for `tint:colorname` and using `tint0-9` colors in styles\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.174\n- Named elements (`<div$myname>`) exist immediately in components\n- Fix: Spread operator works for any expression in objects\n- Fix: Make sure ::before/after comes last in selectors with other pseudo-classes>\n- Fix: Allow symbol keys in `prop/attr #my-sym-key`\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.173\n\n- Fix: Allow binding tag properties to symbol identifiers\n- Report correct location for \"Cannot redeclare variable\" error (#114)\n- Experimental support for `@hotkey` events\n- Fix: Don't run `imba.commit` on unhandled events>\n- Added `@trusted` event guard\n- Added `@trap` event modifier\n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.172\n\n- Fix: Rendering list inside conditional\n- Support css blocks inside conditionals in tag trees\n- Warn about interpolated style values outside of tag trees\n- Improved specificity for nested css rules  \n\n## 2.0.0-alpha.171\n\n- Fix: Make `<global @resize>` work correctly\n- Fix: Variable resolution for `let item = do ... item()`\n- Fix: Allow ternary in tag trees\n- Fix: Allow `condition && <tag>` in tag trees\n- Fix: Ternary parsing `cond ?

This also works with assets, ie. declaring <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">\"icons/*\": &#91;\"assets/svg/*\",\"assets/codicons/*&#93;</app-code-inline> in your tsconfig would allow <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">&lt;svg src=\"icons/some-icon.svg\"&gt;</app-code-inline> to work anywhere in your project.</p></li>\n<li><p>Remove support for path aliases in <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">imbaconfig.json</app-code-inline></p><p>  If you had declared path aliases in an <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">imbaconfig.json</app-code-inline> these should be moved into a <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">&#91;js|ts&#93;config.json</app-code-inline> instead.</p></li>\n<li><p>Remove backwards compatible transforms from compiler itself.</p><p>  Previously we included a bunch of logic for transforming conditional assignments like <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">??=</app-code-inline>,<app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">&&=</app-code-inline>, and <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">||=</app-code-inline> to support older browsers and node versions. Now we compile these statements as is and rely on esbuild to transform when needed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Remove support for <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">?=</app-code-inline> operator - use <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">??=</app-code-inline> instead.</p></li>\n<li><p>Drop commonjs target from compiler</p><p>  The imba compiler will now always compile import/export statements natively\n  to import/export in javascript, and instead rely on esbuild to convert the output to cjs when needed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Simplify output from <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">imba build</app-code-inline></p><p>  The output of imba build is now possible to run directly through node (and soon Bun). We </p></li>\n<li><p>Allow running html file directly with <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">imba some-entry.html</app-code-inline></p><p>  This will spawn a dev-server for this html file and its referenced scripts and stylesheets.</p></li>\n<li><p>Allow testing client-side scripts with <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">imba --web some-entry.imba</app-code-inline></p><p>  This will spawn a dev-server, a html entrypoint and all that is needed to run a script in the browser.</p></li>\n<li><p>Copy static assets over from <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">public</app-code-inline> when building</p><p>  If you have a <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">public</app-code-inline> directory in your project, files from this will be copied over to the public folder of your output dir (default <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">dist</app-code-inline>) when building.</p></li>\n<li><p>Allow prefixing asset paths via <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">--base</app-code-inline> option</p><p>  Ie, when building for github pages you would run <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">imba build --base /my-repo-name -o docs index.html</app-code-inline> to build your files and assets with the correct prefix, into the <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">docs/</app-code-inline> folder of your project to adhere to github pages convetions.</p></li>\n<li><p>Support loading workers following vite conventions</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{}\" data-path=\"/changelog/1\"><code data-lang=\"\">import MyWorker from './some/script?worker'\nimport MySharedWorker from './some/script?sharedworker'\nimport url from './some/script?worker&url'</code></app-code-block></li>\n<li><p>Set node14.13.0 as the default minimum target when building for node.</p><p>  This can be overridden by supplying your version of node through the <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">--node.target</app-code-inline> option. Ie <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">imba build --node.target node12 my/script.imba</app-code-inline></p></li>\n<li><p>Fixed regression in router that caused routed elements inside the root component to fail.</p></li>\n</ul>\n"

This release does contain a few breaking changes, both in relation to styles and memoization. We&#39;ll update the docs at imba.io and publish a screencast going over the changes to make it easier to transition to this new version. Changes;</p><ul>\n<li><p>Rename $key to key</p><p>  To give elements a stable identity (usually inside lists) you should now use <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">&lt;el key=value&gt;</app-code-inline> instead of <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">&lt;el $key=value&gt;</app-code-inline>. <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">$key</app-code-inline> is deprecated and will be removed in <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">beta.1</app-code-inline>. </p></li>\n<li><p>Allow using any object as <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">&lt;element key=...&gt;</app-code-inline> value</p><p>  Keyed elements now use a <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">Map</app-code-inline> instead of a plain object to keep track of unique elements. This means that any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as keys.</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{}\" data-path=\"/changelog/13\"><code data-lang=\"imba\">const items = [{title: \"One\"},{title: \"Two\"}]\n\ntag App\n    &lt;self&gt; for item in items\n        # objects themselves can be used as keys now\n        &lt;AppItem key=item data=item&gt;</code></app-code-block></li>\n<li><p>New (improved) syntax for rendering functional components / tag trees</p><p>  This was the main change holding us back from reaching beta, as it is a breaking change for most users. When you want to include external live dom elements from getters or methods outside of the render-tree, wrap the expression in <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">&lt;(expression)&gt;</app-code-inline>.</p><p>  Besides simplifying the way memoization works it also allows you to add classes and styles to these external fragments, making it vastly more flexible than before.</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{}\" data-path=\"/changelog/14\"><code data-lang=\"imba\">tag App\n    get body\n        &lt;div&gt; \"This is body\"\n\n    def list title, items\n        &lt;section&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt; title\n            &lt;ul&gt; for item in items\n                &lt;li&gt; item.title\n\n    &lt;self&gt;\n        &lt;( body )&gt;\n        &lt;( list 'Top', data.popular ).large [mt:2]&gt;\n        &lt;( list 'New', data.posts.slice(0,10) )&gt;</code></app-code-block></li>\n<li><p>Log warnings to console when building/running without minification</p><p>  Added runtime checks that notify about erroneous behaviour when building/running w/o minification. Initially it will only warn about non-memoized elements being created during rendering. Eventually we&#39;ll use these conventions to add much more elobrate checks and readable error messages for the most common issues users can run into.</p></li>\n<li><p>Allow instantiating elements w/o memoization using <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">new</app-code-inline></p><p>  Imba will automagically allow any element (literal tag) in any method to be memoized.</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{}\" data-path=\"/changelog/15\"><code data-lang=\"imba\">def wrap text\n    let div = &lt;div.item&gt; text\n    return div\n\nimba.mount do &lt;section&gt;\n    &lt;( wrap \"One\" )&gt;\n    &lt;( wrap \"Two\" )&gt;</code></app-code-block><p>  If you call a method or access a getter that returns an element (like <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">def wrap</app-code-inline>) it will look up a memoization context and just reuse/update the div for that particular context. If you call it directly without being in a context, Imba will warn you. There are however some situations where you actually just want to create new elements. In this case, use <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">new</app-code-inline> in front of the element. If the root is not memoized, the children won&#39;t either, so you only need to add <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">new</app-code-inline> in front of the top element.</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{}\" data-path=\"/changelog/16\"><code data-lang=\"imba\">def wrap text\n    let div = new &lt;div.item&gt; text\n    return div</code></app-code-block></li>\n<li><p>Allow non-global tag types in dynamic tag names</p><p>  Local tag types are now allowed in <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">&lt;{tag-type} ...&gt;</app-code-inline> syntax. Previously it would only work when <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">tag-type</app-code-inline> evaluated to a string, and there was a globally defined web component or native tag with that name. Now it works with classes as well.</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{}\" data-path=\"/changelog/17\"><code data-lang=\"imba\">import {PostView,ArticleView} from './views'\n\nconst items = [\n    { type: Post, title: \"My post\"}\n    { type: Article, title: \"My article\"}\n]\n\ntag App\n    &lt;self&gt;\n        for item in items\n            &lt;{item.type} data=item&gt;</code></app-code-block></li>\n<li><p>Only allow named elements inside <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">&lt;self&gt;</app-code-inline></p><p>  Using named elements (<app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">&lt;div$myname&gt;</app-code-inline>) outside of self would previously introduce subtle bugs and conflicts. They are now only allowed inside of <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">&lt;self&gt;</app-code-inline>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Changed css specificity</p><p>  Styles declared in tag declaration body now has lower specificity than class selectors.</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{}\" data-path=\"/changelog/18\"><code data-lang=\"imba\">css .warn hue:red\ncss .large p:4 fs:lg\n\ntag Button\n    css p:2 fs:sm hue:blue\n\n# styles from classes take precedence\n&lt;Button.warn.large&gt;</code></app-code-block></li>\n<li><p>Scoped selectors no longer applies to self</p><p>  Now, selectors like <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">.warn</app-code-inline> declared in tag declaration body only applies to elements <em>inside</em> <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">Button</app-code-inline>, not the button itself.

          "body": "# Importing Assets\n\nImages, stylesheets and other assets are an important part of any web application. These things are integrated right into imba without any need for external bundlers like webpack or rollup. \n\n## Importing stylesheets\n\nEven though you can style all of your app using the imba css syntax you might want to import external stylesheets as well. Import these just like you would import any other file.\n\n```imba app.imba\nimport './assets/normalize.css'\n\ntag App\n\t# ...\n```\n\nIn the example above, the content of the normalize.css file will automagically be imported and bundled alongside your other styles.\n\nYou can also import the css generated by imba via a non-standard `src` attribute on the `style` element. This is especially useful for ssr applications where you don't want to ship your rendering code to the client, but obviously want the styles:\n\n```imba server.imba\nimport {App} from './app'\napp.get(/.*/) do(req,res)\n\tres.send String <html>\n\t\t<head>\n\t\t\t<title> \"Application\"\n\t\t\t<style src='./app'>\n\t\t<body> <App>\n```\n\n```imba app.imba\nglobal css\n\tbody bg:gray2 # ...\n\nexport tag App\n\t<self>\n\t\t<div[fw:bold]> \"Welcome\"\n```\n\n## Importing images\n\nAny relative url reference you have in your styles will be extracted, hashed, and included with your bundled code.\n\n```imba app.imba\ntag App\n\t<self> <div[ bg:url(./logo.png) ]>\n```\n\nAlso, relative src attributes on `<img>` elements will automatically be handled as assets\n\n```imba app.imba\ntag App\n\t<self> <img src='./logo.png'>\n```\n\nIf you want to reference and use these images from your code as well, you can import them:\n\n```imba app.imba\nimport logo from './logo.png'\n\ntag App\n\t<self> <img src=logo>\n```\n\nThese imported assets even have valuable metadata added to them:\n\n```imba app.imba\nimport logo from './logo.png'\n\nlogo.url # the unique hashed url for this image\nlogo.size # size of assets - in bytes\nlogo.hash # unique hash of the contents of the asset\nlogo.body # the actual contents of the asset - only available on server\nlogo.width # width of the imported image\nlogo.height # height of the imported image\n\ntag App\n\t<self> <img src=logo width=logo.width>\n```\n\nYou can also use the dynamic import syntax for assets:\n\n```imba app.imba\nconst states = {\n\topen: import('./icons/alert-circle.svg')\n\tclosed: import('./icons/check-circle.svg')\n\tarchived: import('./icons/package.svg')\n}\n\n<div> for issue in issues\n\t<div>\n\t\t<img.icon src=states[issue.state]>\n\t\t<span> issue.title\n```\n\nYou can even interpolate these dynamic asset imports in css:\n\n```imba app.imba\nconst states = {\n\topen: import('./icons/alert-circle.svg')\n\tclosed: import('./icons/check-circle.svg')\n\tarchived: import('./icons/package.svg')\n}\n\n<div> for issue in issues\n\t<div>\n\t\t<.icon[ bg:{states[issue.state]} ]>\n\t\t<.title> issue.title\n```\n\n## Importing svgs\n\nSVGs can be imported and used just like other image assets described in the previous section. It does include some nice additional things though. You can use SVG images via css and the img-tag, but they really shine when you inline them in your html. Ie, if you want to use SVG images for icons you have to inline them to be able to change their color, stroke-width etc.\n\nSo, Imba adds a non-standard `src` attribute to `svg` elements, that magically inlines the actual content of the svg directly in your html.\n\n```imba app.imba\n<div>\n\t# the package.svg will now be inlined in this tag\n\t<svg src='./icons/package.svg'>\n```\n\nThis also allows us to style the contents directly:\n\n```imba app.imba\n<div>\n\t# change color on hover\n\t<svg[c:gray6 @hover:blue7] src='./icons/package.svg'>\n\t# override stroke-width \n\t<svg[stroke-width:4px] src='./icons/check.svg'>\n```\n\n## Importing scripts\n\nImba will analyze the `src` attribute of `script` elements and automatically package these files for you. So a typical project with server *and* client code will follow this pattern:\n\n```imba server.imba\n# some express server ...\napp.on(/.*/) do(req,res)\n\tres.send String <html>\n\t\t<head>\n\t\t\t<title> \"Gobias Industries\"\n\t\t<body>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"module\" src=\"./client\">\n```\n\n```imba client.imba\n# some client code here\n```\n\nWhen you run `imba server.imba` in the above example, imba will discover the reference to client.imba and create a bundle for the `client.imba` entrypoint. Using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) in the background, bundling is so fast that it literally happens every time you start your server – *there is no need for a separate build step*.\n\n## Importing workers\n\nImba aims for zero-configuration bundling even with large projects. You can import scripts as separate assets via a special import syntax.\n\n```imba app.imba\n\nconst script = import.worker './compiler'\n# script is now an asset reference to the bundled compiler entrypoint.\nscript.url # reference to the unique/hashed url of this script\nscript.body # node only - actual contents of the bundle\n\nconst worker = new Worker(script.url)\n```\n\nTo showcase how flexible and useful this is – on imba.io we are using a serviceworker to run examples. Serviceworkers need to be served from the directory / scope you want them to control, and their url need to be static. The asset urls generated by imba are usually hashed *and* put inside a special `__assets__` folder:\n\n```imba app.imba\nconst sw = import.worker './sw/service'\nsw.url # /__assets__/sw/worker.JNA7FI8P.js\n```\nThis url changes whenever the content changes and is nested inside an `/__assets__/...` prefix, both of which can be challenging for a serviceworker. So, our solution was to create a static route in our server, and just serve the asset directly:\n\n```imba app.imba\napp.get('/sw.js') do(req,res)\n\tconst asset = import.worker('./sw/service')\n\tres.send asset.body\n```\n\n## Custom imports\n\nThe `import.worker` syntax shown in the previous section is not a special syntax just for workers. In fact, the `import.anything(...)` is a general way to import something using a specific configuration. You can create such configurations in your `imbaconfig.json`. Imba comes with a few presets:\n\n```imba presets.imba\nexport const presets = \n\tnode:\n\t\tplatform: 'node'\n\t\tformat: 'cjs'\n\t\tsourcemap: true\n\t\ttarget: ['node12.19.0']\n\t\texternal: ['dependencies','!imba']\n\t\t\n\tweb:\n\t\tplatform: 'browser'\n\t\ttarget: ['es2020','chrome58','firefox57','safari11','edge16']\n\t\tsourcemap: true\n\t\tformat: 'esm'\n\t\t\n\tiife:\n\t\textends: 'web'\n\t\tformat: 'iife'\n\t\t\n\tclient:\n\t\textends: 'web'\n\t\tsplitting: true\n\t\t\n\tworker:\n\t\tformat: 'esm'\n\t\tplatform: 'worker'\n\t\tsplitting: false\n\n```\n\nMost of the properties map directly to [esbuild options](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#simple-options), with some additions for imba specific things. Configuration options will be explained in more detail before final 2.0 release. In most projects you will not need to think about or tweak these configs.\n\n## Future plans\n\n### Glob imports\n\nWe are working on smart glob imports for a future release.\n\n```imba app.imba\nimport icons from './feather/*.svg'\n\n# contains all matching assets:\nicons.check\nicons.circle\n...\n```\n\nThis will also work directly in src paths, like:\n\n```imba app.imba\n<div> for issue in issues\n\t<div>\n\t\t<svg src=\"./icons/{issue.state}.svg\">\n\t\t<div.title> issue.title\n```\n\n### Importing wasm\n\nWill be part of a future release.\n\n",

          "body": "# Basic Syntax\n\n**The Imba course launched! Learn Imba through fully interactive screencasts:** <https://scrimba.com/learn/imba>\n\nA good way to think of Imba is, \"it’s just JavaScript\". Imba compiles directly to readable JavaScript. This means that every native type with all of their methods, properties and behaviour are the exact same. So, strings are just strings, arrays are just arrays, and so on.\n\n## Literals\n\n[Watch the scrim on syntax in the Imba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/imba/intro-to-imba-syntax-cpwyK7Tz)\n\nImba syntax is familiar and often the same as JavaScript. Let's look at some examples of [literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Literal). The comments below highlight  how Imba can be both easier to read and faster to write.\n\n```imba\nconst number = 42\nconst string = \"the answer is 42\"\nconst alsoString = \"the answer is {number}\" # No need for backtick strings or ${}.\nconst regex = /answer is (\\d+)/\nconst array = [1, 2, 3]\nconst bool = true\nconst alsoBool = yes # You can write booleans as yes and no.\nconst object = { name: 'Imba', type: 'language' }\nconst alsoObject = name: 'Imba', type: 'language' # You can skip the curly braces.\nconst indentedObject = # For indented objects, you can skip the commas.\n    name: 'Imba'\n    version: 2.0\n    repository: 'https://github.com/imba/imba'\n    inspiration: ['ruby', 'python', 'react', 'coffeescript']\n```\n\n## Imba literal types\n\nThe following types do not exist in JavaScript, and are a vital part of making Imba fast and easy to use.\n\n```imba\nconst duration = 150ms\nconst longerDuration = 42s\nconst element = <div.large.header> \"Welcome\"\nconst alsoElement = <div.{object.name}> \"{object.name} class\" # Easy interpolation, using the object above.\n```\n\n\n## Functions\n\n_Note: Differences between functions and arrow functions are covered in the [functions overview](/docs/functions)._\n\n[Watch the scrim on functions in the Imba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/imba/functions-cJLGEQCB)\n\n\nImba uses the shorter `def` instead of the `function` keyword. `do` instead of `() => {}`. These are faster to write, read, and recognize at a glance.\n\n```imba\ndef func(a, b)\n    return a * b\n\ndef alsoFunc(a, b)\n    a * b # Implicit return\n\nconst smallerFunc = do(a, b) a * b # Implicit return on one line\n```\n\n\n## Strings\n\n```imba\nconst single = 'single quotes'\nconst double = \"double quotes\"\nconst interpolation = \"string has {double}\"\nconst template = `current version is {indentedObject.version}` # Interpolating using the object above.\n```\n\nImba uses `{}` for string interpolation while JavaScript uses `${}`. If you want interpolated strings with literal curly-braces, remember to escape them with `\\`. Other than that, the String type is identical to String in JavaScript. See documentation at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String).\n\nRegular string literals can be written over multiple lines, but line breaks are ignored.\n\n```imba\nconst multipleLines = 'one\ntwo three'\nconsole.log(multipleLines) # Logs \"onetwo three\"\n```\n\nIf you need a string that spans several lines and includes line breaks, use a sequence of characters surrounded by `'''` or `\"\"\"`.\n\n```imba\nconst lineBreaks = '''\nThis string is written\nover multiple lines\n'''\nconsole.log(lineBreaks) # Logs \"This string\\nis written over\\nmultiple lines\"\n```\n\nMultiline strings preserves indentation, but only relative to the least indented line.\n\n```imba\nconst stringIndentation = '''\n    First level is ignored\n        This is indented\n    Not indented\n    '''\n```\n\nTagged templates let you parse template literals with a function in the same way [JavaScript does](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).\n\n```imba\nconst person = 'Mike'\nconst age = 28\n\ndef myTag(strings, personExp, ageExp)\n    const str0 = strings[0] # \"That \"\n    const str1 = strings[1] # \" is a \"\n    const str2 = strings[2] # \".\"\n\n    const ageStr = (ageExp > 99) ? 'centenarian' : 'youngster'\n\n    # We can even return a string built using a template literal\n    \"{str0}{personExp}{str1}{ageStr}{str2}\"\n\nconst output = myTag`That {person} is a {age}.`\n\nconsole.log(output) # Logs \"That Mike is a youngster.\"\n```\n\n## Arrays\n\nArrays work the same way as in JavaScript. In Imba you can also declare them over multiple lines, where the value of each line represents an entry in the array. Commas are optional when array elements are separated by line breaks.\n\n```imba\nconst withCommas = [\n    'one',\n    'two',\n    'three',\n    'four',\n]\n\nconst withoutCommas = [\n    'one'\n    'two'\n    'three'\n    'four'\n]\n\nconsole.log(withCommas, withoutCommas) # [ 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four' ] [ 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four' ]\n```\n\n## Objects\n\nObjects work the same way as in JavaScript. As with the arrays above, commas are optional when separated by line breaks. Curly braces are optional when the separating colon makes it clear what the keys and values are.\n\n```imba\nconst object = { a: 'foo', b: 42, c: {} }\nconst person =\n    name: 'Bob Smith'\n    age: 32\n    gender: 'male'\n\n# Curly braces are optional as the keys and values are clear:\ndef logObject(object)\n    console.log(\"Logging:\", object)\n\nlogObject(name: 'Rincewind', profession: 'Wizzard') # Logs \"Logging: { name: 'Rincewind', profession: 'Wizzard' }\"\n```\n\n\nThey can be set dynamically by wrapping a variable with `[]`.\n\n```imba\nconst field = 'age'\nconst person = { name: 'Bob Smith', [field]: 32, gender: 'male' }\nconsole.log(person.age) # Logs \"32\"\n```\n\nProperties work the same way as in JavaScript. They can be accessed and assigned using the `.` operator. The `const` keyword prevents re-assignment, but internals can still be modified.\n\n```imba\nconst person = { name: 'Bob Smith', age: 32, gender: 'male' }\nperson.name\nperson.age = 33\n\nconsole.log(person.age) # Logs \"33\"\n```\n\nKeys work the same way as in JavaScript.\n\n```imba\nconst person = { name: 'Bob Smith', age: 32, gender: 'male' }\n\nperson['name']\nperson['age'] = 33\n\nconsole.log(person.age) # Logs \"33\"\n```\n\nDestructuring (as defined in ES6) works the same way as in JavaScript.\n\n_Note: Destructuring and skipping curly braces can get confusing. It is not recommended to combine these two features, as it makes the code hard to understand, and easy to cause bugs._\n\n```imba\nconst a = 'foo'\nconst b = 42\nconst c = {}\nconst object = { a, b, c }\n\nconsole.log(object) # Logs \"{ a: 'foo', b: 42, c: {} }\"\n```\n\n\n## Methods\n\nParenthesis can be skipped, even when setting default values.\n\n```imba\ndef withArgument param\n\tconsole.log param\n\nwithArgument(42) # Logs \"42\"\n\ndef withDefaultValue name = 'Imba'\n\tconsole.log name\n\nwithDefaultValue() # Logs \"Imba\"\n```\n\nObjects can be deconstructed like normal, and given default values.\n\n```imba\ndef method name, { title, desc = 'no description' }\n\tconsole.log name, title, desc\n\nconsole.log method('Rincewind', title: 'Wizzard') # Logs \"Rincewind Wizzard no description\"\n```\n\n## Classes\n\n_Note: More details about classes are in the [class overview](/docs/classes)._\n\n[Watch the scrim on classes in the Imba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/imba/classes-cbVveMS4)\n\nClasses in Imba can do the same things as classes in JavaScript, but have several additional features making them easier to use. \n\n```imba\nclass Todo\n\t# Properties are member variables:\n\tprop title\n\tprop completed = no\n\tprop due = null\n\n\t# Methods are instance level functions:\n\tdef complete\n\t\tcompleted = yes\n\n\t# Getters:\n\tget overdue\n\t\tdue and due < new Date\n\n\n\t# Static methods are class level functions:\n\tstatic def createTodos titles\n\t\ttitles.map do(title)\n\t\t\tnew Todo(title: title)\n\n\nconst todo = new Todo title: 'Read introduction'\n\nconsole.log todo # Logs \"Todo { title: 'Read introduction', completed: false, due: null }\"\n```\n\nInstance level methods are called on the object made from the class.\n\n```imba\nconst myTodo = new Todo title: 'Learn Imba'\nmyTodo.complete()\n\nconsole.log myTodo # Logs \"Todo { title: 'Learn Imba', completed: true, due: null }\"\n```\n\nClass level methods are called directly on the class.\n\n```imba\nconst newTodos = Todo.createTodos ['Learn Imba', 'Eat breakfast']\n\nconsole.log newTodos\n# Logs:\n# [\n#   Todo { title: 'Learn Imba', completed: false, due: null },\n#   Todo { title: 'Eat breakfast', completed: false, due: null }\n# ]\n```\n\n\n## Loops & Iteration\n\n[Watch the scrim on loops in the Imba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/imba/loops-co2eb439ab71581a6ad3f0ea1)\n\nLoops in Imba have more useful features than in JavaScript, making it easier to loop over object properties.\n\n[Iterables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols) can be looped over with `for ... of ...`.\n\n```imba\nfor todo, index of newTodos\n    console.log \"{todo.title} at position {index}\"\n    # Logs:\n    # \"Learn Imba at position 0\"\n    # \"Eat breakfast at position 1\"\n```\n\nTo loop over keys and values in an object automatically, use the `own` keyword for the object.\n\n```imba\nconst object =\n    hello: 'world'\n    learning: 'imba'\n    answer: 42\n\nfor own key, value of object\n    console.log \"{key}: {value}\"\n    # Logs:\n    # hello: world\n    # learning: imba\n    # answer: 42\n```\n\nLooping within tags works the same way.\n\n[Watch the scrim on looping within tags in the Imba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/imba/loops-inside-tags-co59443e78abc774ac34f72f4)\n\n\n## Regular Expressions\n\nRegular expressions work as in JavaScript, with the additional benefit of whitespace and comments in multi line regexes.\n\n```imba\nconst literal = /ab+c/i\nconst regex = new RegExp('ab+c', 'i')\nconst multiline = ///\n    ab+ # allows comments and whitespace\n    c\n///\n```\n\n## Ranges\n\nRanges use three dots within brackets `[0 ... 10]`, counting up until the upper number. This makes it easy to use with `myArray.length` without having to write `myArray.length - 1`.\n\n```imba\nconst items = []\nfor i in [1 ... 5]\n    items.push(i)\n\nconsole.log items # Logs [1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\n## Elements\n\nThe web is native to Imba, so elements are \"first class citizens\" just like other native types.\n\n```imba\nconst list = <ul title=\"reminders\">\n    <li> \"Remember milk\"\n    <li> \"Greet visitor\"\n```\n\nCSS classes are set with dots, and can be both dynamically interpolated and conditionally set. This lets you use logic inside elements, keeping the code short and simple.\n\n```imba\nconst state = 'open'\nconst condition = no\n\n<div.panel.large> \"With classes\"\n<div.state-{state}> \"Dynamic class name\"\n<div.hidden=condition> \"Conditionally hidden\"\n<div.panel.state-{state} .hidden=condition> \"Dynamic and conditional\"\n```\n\nHandlers work the same way.\n\n```imba\nconst handler = do(event)\n    console.log \"Panel clicked!\"\n\n<div.panel @click.prevent=handler> \"Panel\"\n```\n\n## Components\n\n[Watch the scrim on tags in the Imba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/imba/tags-co83d4e259d958441d6c9b8e7)\n\nTags are compiled down to _extremely optimized_ native [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). By default, `data` is the name used to pass values into a tag. Using `data` is simple, but declaring each prop and its type is usually better. \n\n```imba\n# Importing a todos array from another Imba file called \"data.imba\":\nimport { todos } from './data'\n\n# Declaring a web component without specifying props:\ntag todo-item\n    <self .completed=data.completed>\n        <input bind=data.completed type='checkbox'>\n        <span.title> data.title\n        <button @click.stop.emit('remove')> 'x'\n\n# Using the todo-item inside another web component:\ntag todo-app\n    <self> for todo in todos\n        <todo-item data=todo>\n\n# Rendering the todo-app with the imported todos array:\nimba.mount <todo-app data=todos>\n```\n\n## Styles\n\n[Watch the scrim on inline styles in the Imba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/imba/inline-styles-coe2d48f9a05c7b17e6fb46f7)\n\nIn HTML you can set inline styles on an element with `style=\"display: flex;\"`. Using classes is often recommended, as keeping track of these inline styles can be slow, brittle, and difficult to work with.\n\nIn Imba, inline styles are much more powerful. Keeping elements, styles and logic close together can often be simpler, faster to write, and easier to read.\n\n```imba\n<div[display:flex flex-direction:row color:blue]>\n<div[opacity:0.5 @hover:1]> # Conditional styles based on pseudostates.\n<div[padding:3rem @lg:5rem @print:0]> # Conditional styles based on media queries.\n```\n\n### Shorthands\n\n[Watch the scrim on shorthands in the Imba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/imba/style-property-shorthands-co55547d5954f4b8576d0f730)\n\nSingle letter variable names are often considered to be an anti-pattern. Seeing the name `c`, what does it mean? `columns`? `content`? `color`? Reading code with unclear naming costs time and effort.\n\n`c` is shorthand for `color`. But will that always be the case? Could it ever change, and mean `columns` or `content` instead?\n\n```imba\n<div[c:blue]>\n```\n\n**CSS keywords don't change. Imba shorthands don't change.**\n\nStability and consistency builds trust. Let's learn one more: `bg` is shorthand for `background`. Knowing both `bg` and `c`, what does the shorthand `bgc` \"look like\"? `background-color`!\n\nImba shorthands are bound directly to CSS, and remain stable. This makes Imba shorthands quick to read, write, and understand at a glance. `d` will always mean `display`, `p` will always mean `padding`, `m` will always mean `margin`, and so on.\n\n```imba\n<div[display:flex flex-direction:row color:blue]> # Regular keywords\n<div[d:flex fld:row c:blue]> # Shorthand keywords\n```\n\nImba developers often say these shorthand names become as familiar and natural as CSS itself, but faster. The Imba tooling gives you the full keyword on hover, and will even suggest the shorthand if you hover the regular CSS keyword.\n\n### Scoping styles\n\n\n[Watch the scrim on scoping styles in the Imba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/imba/scoped-styles-co50f4384944f5102c6e6d8ca)\n\nInline styles apply to the element itself, and everything within it. Changing the scope lets you apply styles to subtrees, components, tags, the entire file, or even globally.\n\n```imba\n# Set `global` at the top level to style all <p> elements.\nglobal css p fs:15px\n\n# Set at the top level to style every <p> element in the file.\ncss p color:blue7 fw:500 \n\ntag todo-app\n    # Set at the todo-app level to style everything within the tag.\n    css .item color:gray8 bg@hover:gray1\n    css .item.done color:green8 text-decoration:line-through\n\n    <self> for todo in todos\n        <div.item .done=todo.completed> <span> todo.title\n```\n\nStyling can also be nested inside tag trees, and be conditionally included.\n\n```imba\ntag todo-app\n    <self>\n        if user.loggedIn # Styling can be conditional.\n            css .header bg:green2\n\n        <div.header>\n            css .tab # Scoped to the <div.header> only.\n                l:flex mx:2 py:1 fw:500\n                c:teal6 @hover:teal7 @active:teal9\n            <a.tab href='https://github.com/imba/imba'> \"GitHub\"\n            <a.tab href='https://discord.gg/mkcbkRw'> \"Chat\"\n\n        <div.footer>\n            # Not in the <div.header> scope, so the .tab styling is not applied.\n            <a.tab href='https://github.com/imba/imba.io'> \"Documentation\"\n```\n\n## Comments\n\nSingle-line comments in Imba are any text following `# ` on the same line. The space is required.\n\n```imba\n# This is a comment\nconst name = \"imba\" # my favorite language\n```\n\nMultiline comments are opened and closed with `###`.\n\n```imba\n###\nThis color is my favorite\nI need several lines to really\nemphasize this fact.\n###\nconst color = \"blue\"\n```\n\n## Types\n\nType annotations in Imba are compiled to [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) comments and are used for intelligent auto-completions and analysis in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\n```imba\nconst item\\string = window.title\n```\n\nAnnotations are extra useful to create \"contracts\" between parts of your code. It is faster to understand and re-use tags when their props are annotated, for example.\n\nAnnotating is inferred automatically when the value is assigned during declaration.\n\n```imba\ndef multiply a\\number, b\\number\n    a * b\n\n# Rewriting the todo-tag with annotated props makes it easier to understand and use.\ntag todo-item\n    prop completed = no\n    prop title\\string\n\n    <self .completed=completed>\n        <input bind=completed type='checkbox'>\n        <span.title> title\n        <button @click.stop.emit('remove')> 'x'\n```\n\nTypes can also be imported from other `.imba`,`.js`,`.ts`, and `.d.ts` files, if you only want to annotate your code. If we need the actual User class, for example to create a new user with `user = new User()`, then we would need to do a regular import.\n\n```imba\n# Only the type is imported:\nimport type { User } from './models'\n\ntag user-card\n    # The User is annotated here, so we only need the type:\n    prop user\\User\n\n    <self>\n        # We know what kind of object a User is now:\n        <p> user.name\n        <img src=user.profile alt=\"Profile picture\"> \n```\n",

          "body": "# Classes\n\nClasses are general-purpose, flexible constructs that become the building blocks of your program's code. You define properties and methods to add functionality to your classes using the same syntax you use to define constants, variables, and functions. Classes in Imba are compiled directly to native [JavaScript Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes).\n\n## Defining Classes\n\n```imba\nclass Rect\n    # custom constructor\n    constructor w,h\n        width = w\n        height = h\n\n    # class method\n    def expand hor,ver = hor\n        width += hor\n        height += ver\n\n    # getter\n    get area\n        width * height\n\n    # setter\n    set area size\n        width = height = Math.sqrt size\n```\n\n## Creating Instances\n\nThe `new` keyword will let you create an instance of your class. This instance inherits properties and methods from its class.\n\n```imba\nlet fido = new Dog\n```\n\n## Class Constructors\n\nUse the `constructor` keyword to declare a custom constructor method for your class. This method will be executed whenever an instance of the class is created (using the `new` keyword).\n\n```imba\nclass Rect\n    constructor w,h\n        width = w\n        height = h\n    # ...\n```\n\n## Instance Methods\n\nYou can add methods to your class instances using the `def` keyword, followed by the method name and optional arguments.\n\n```imba\nclass Rect\n    def expand hor,ver = hor\n        width += hor\n        height += ver\n```\n\n## Class Fields\n\nInstance fields exist on every created instance of a class. By declaring a field, you can ensure the field is always present, and the class definition is more self-documenting. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Public_class_fields) for more details.\n\n```imba\nclass Rect\n\twidth = 10\n\theight = 10\n```\n\n> instances of Rect will always be initialized with width and height set to 10.\n\nThe scope after `=` in a class field refers to the instance itself, so class fields can also reference other properties and methods.\n\n```imba\nclass Rect\n\twidth = 10\n\theight = 10\n\tarea = width * height\n\nconsole.log (new Rect).area # 100\n```\n\n## Computed Properties\n\nYou can add computed properties to your class instances using the `get` keyword followed by the name of the property. The `get` syntax binds an object property to a function that will be called when that property is looked up\n\n```imba\nclass Rect\n    get area\n        width * height\n```\n\nUsing `set` you can define a function that will be called when there is an attempt to set that property.\n\n```imba\nclass Rect\n    set sides value\n        width = value\n        height = value\n```\n\nYou can define setters which are to be called whenever there is an attempt to set that property.\n\n## Lazy Getters [wip]\n\nAny getter is bound only when first accessed. A lazy getter will in addition only determine its value the first time it is accessed and from then on return the initial value which can be memoized. This is done with a falsy assignment `||=`.\n\n```imba\nclass Component\n    # The symbol #ref is only set the first time Component.ref is accessed\n    get ref\n        #ref ||= utils.uuid! \n```\n\n## Computed Names\n\nYou can define methods, getters and setters with computed names using `[]`.\n\n```imba\nlet method = 'items'\nlet getter = 'title'\n\nclass Todo\n    get [getter]\n        data[getter]\n\n    def [method]\n        console.log \"called method {method}\"\n\nlet todo = new Todo\ntodo.items! # called method items\ntodo.title\n```\n\n## Meta Properties\n\nUpcoming versions of JavaScript has support for \"private fields\" using the `#` prefix for properties. Imba has a similar syntax that serves a similar purpose. See [Meta Properties]. Meta properties can be used in classes for method, fields, and other properties.\n\nMeta properties are implemented as symbols, They do not show up on an Object using `for in`, `for of`, `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` or `Object.keys`, and they will never conflict with string-based / plain properties on your classes & instances. These are useful for a wide variety of things and are used extensively in the imba runtime itself.\n\nYou may often find yourself defining setters because you want to do something when a property is set. The problem is that a property with a setter cannot also store an actual value with the same name. The idiomatic way to store underlying values in setters is to use a meta property with the same name:\n\n```imba\nclass Todo\n    set title value\n        # do something here\n        #title = value\n\n    get title\n        #title\n```\n\nThis is also useful if you want to declare memoized / lazy fields, where the value of the field should not be initialized until the first time it is accessed.\n\n```imba\nclass Component\n    get ref\n        #ref ||= utils.uuid!\n```\n\nLet's say we want to add a `#ref` property to _all objects_ - that returns a unique id for every object. As in the example above, we only want to create the id if/when it is accessed. We don't want to pollute every object with a visible textual `ref` property that may interfere with other code and libraries, so we use a meta property for this.\n\n```imba\nconst map = new WeakMap\n\nextend class Object\n    get #ref\n        map.set(self,utils.uuid!) unless map.has(self)\n        return map.get(self)\n```\n\nThe above approach of using a WeakMap to store the actual metadata is common, and even the way Babel and other transpilers usually implement private fields today. But weakmaps are quite slow and clunky. Remember that meta properties start with one _or more_ `#` characters. The convention in Imba is to always prepend an additional `#` for each nested level of indirectness. So, instead we would extend Object like this:\n\n```imba\nextend class Object\n    get #ref\n        ##ref ||= utils.uuid!\n```\n\nNow you will be able to access `#ref` on _all_ objects.\n\n```imba\nconst object = {}\nobject.#ref # '... uuid ...'\n# Even built in objects now have this property\nwindow.#ref\n```\n\n### Extending native types\n\nYou can also use meta properties for methods and class fields. Since they are not enumerable, and won't collide with native methods from JavaScript it is great if you want to extend native prototypes. Imba adds a bunch of methods to the native Node / Element classes in your browser, but to be sure that it does not interact with other libraries, these methods are implemented using meta properties.\n\n```imba\nextend class Node\n    def #append node\n        # setup some listeners etc\n        appendChild(node)\n```\n\nIn your own projects you could even add functionality to _all_ objects without worry using meta properties.\n\n```imba\nconst map = new WeakMap\n\nextend class Object\n    get #ref\n        map.set(self,Symbol()) unless map.has(self)\n        return map.get(self)\n\n# Now you will be able to access `.#ref` on _all_ objects,\n# and get a unique symbol back every time.\nconst object = {}\nobject.#ref # Symbol()\n```\n\n### Private or not?\n\nUnlike in js, these properties are not strictly private. You can access them from outside just like other properties. So if a class has a method called `#synchronize`, you _can_ call it from outside by `instance.#synchronize!`. At the same time, meta properties are usually used for \"internals\".\n\n## Static Properties\n\nMethods, fields and computed properties can also be defined on the class itself, as opposed to its instances, by including the `static` keyword before each declaration.\n\n```imba\nclass Rect\n\tstatic size = 50\n\tsize = 100\nconsole.log Rect.size # 50\nconsole.log (new Rect).size # 100\n```\n\n```imba\nclass Rect\n\tstatic def build side\n\t\tlet item = new self\n\t\titem.width = item.height = side\n\t\treturn item\n\nRect.build(10)\n```\n\n## Class Inheritance\n\nAn important feature of Classes is the ability to inherit from other classes. For example, a Dog is also an Animal, so it makes sense to inherit the properties of an Animal so that if we ever update the Animal class, the Dog's class will also be updated. It will also help us keep our code light.\n\n```imba\nclass Animal\n\tconstructor name\n\t\tname = name\n\n    def move distance = 0\n        console.log \"Animal moved {distance} meters.\"\n\n    def speak\n        console.log \"{name} makes a noise.\"\n\nclass Dog < Animal\n    def speak\n        console.log \"{name} barks.\"\n\nlet dog = new Dog 'Mitzie'\ndog.move 10 # Animal moved 10 meters.\ndog.speak! # Mitzie barks.\n```\n\nAn inherited class will inherit all methods and functionality from the parent class.\n\nIf the heritor class accesses any variables or functions on self in its constructor, the constructor must first call `super`.\n\n```imba\nclass Animal\n\tconstructor name\n\t\tname = name\n\nclass Dog < Animal\n    constructor name, breed\n        super # calls Animal constructor with the same arguments (name, breed).\n        # super(name) # This would be an explit way to achieve the same effect\n        breed = breed\n\nlet dog = new Dog 'Mitzie', 'Pug'\nconsole.log dog.name\ndog.speak! # Mitzie barks.\n```\n\n### Using `super`\n\n##### super\n\n```imba\nclass Designer < Person\n\tdef greet greeting\n        console.log 'will greet'\n\t\tsuper # same as super.greet(...arguments)\n```\n\nLone `super` is treated in a special way. It is always equivalent to calling the same method in super class, passing along the arguments from the current method.\n\n##### super ( arguments )\n\n```imba\nclass Designer < Person\n\tdef greet greeting\n\t\tsuper \"Hey {greeting}\" # same as super.greet\n```\n\n##### super.property\n\n```imba\nclass Animal\n\tconstructor name\n\t\tname = name\n\n    def move distance = 0\n        console.log \"Animal moved {distance} meters.\"\n\n    def speak\n        console.log \"{name} makes a noise.\"\n\nclass Dog < Animal\n    def speak\n        console.log \"{name} barks.\"\n\n    def move distance = 0\n        super.speak! # call the Animal#speak method directly!\n        console.log \"{name} ran {distance} meters.\"\n\nlet dog = new Dog 'Mitzie'\ndog.move 10 # Mitzie makes a noise. Mitzie ran 10 meters.\n```\n",

These are useful for a wide variety of things and are used extensively in the imba runtime itself.</p><p>You may often find yourself defining setters because you want to do something when a property is set. The problem is that a property with a setter cannot also store an actual value with the same name. The idiomatic way to store underlying values in setters is to use a meta property with the same name:</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{}\" data-path=\"/docs/classes/11\"><code data-lang=\"imba\">class Todo\n    set title value\n        # do something here\n        #title = value\n\n    get title\n        #title</code></app-code-block><p>This is also useful if you want to declare memoized / lazy fields, where the value of the field should not be initialized until the first time it is accessed.</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{}\" data-path=\"/docs/classes/12\"><code data-lang=\"imba\">class Component\n    get ref\n        #ref ||= utils.uuid!</code></app-code-block><p>Let&#39;s say we want to add a <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">#ref</app-code-inline> property to <em>all objects</em> - that returns a unique id for every object. As in the example above, we only want to create the id if/when it is accessed. We don&#39;t want to pollute every object with a visible textual <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">ref</app-code-inline> property that may interfere with other code and libraries, so we use a meta property for this.</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{}\" data-path=\"/docs/classes/13\"><code data-lang=\"imba\">const map = new WeakMap\n\nextend class Object\n    get #ref\n        map.set(self,utils.uuid!) unless map.has(self)\n        return map.get(self)</code></app-code-block><p>The above approach of using a WeakMap to store the actual metadata is common, and even the way Babel and other transpilers usually implement private fields today.

The convention in Imba is to always prepend an additional <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">#</app-code-inline> for each nested level of indirectness.

Should only be needed for debugging.\n\n* `-v, --verbose`\n\n    Disregard previously cached imba compilations and other optimizations and make sure all files are compiled now. Should only be needed for debugging.\n\n* `--base [prefix]`\n    \n    If you are deploying your project under a nested public path, specify the `base` option and all asset paths will be rewritten accordingly.\n\n* `-M, --no-minifiy`\n\n    Disable minification. This is useful for configurations where minification is enabled by default, like for `imba build`.\n\n* `-S, --no-sourcemap`\n\n    Disable sourcemaps. This is useful for configurations where sourcemaps are enabled by default, like for `imba serve`, `imba-dev`.\n\n* `-d, --development`\n\n    Builds file with the `NODE_ENV=\"development\"`, as well as including additional code to make debugging your imba projects easier. \n\n* `-p, --production`\n\n    Build/run the script for clients. If you run an imba file with the `--web` argument it will automatically generate an accompanying html file and serve it up for your browser.\n\n* `-i, --instances [n]`\n\n    If you specify n > 1, imba will run the script as a cluster and spawn *n* instances. In development mode it will gracefully reload instances when the\n    code has changed. Currently not applicable for `build`.\n\n* `--esm`\n\n    Executes the script as a module. Only supported on Node v14.13+. Since Imba bundles and resolves dependencies using esbuild this will not be needed in most cases.\n\n* `--web`\n\n    Build/run the script for clients. If you run an imba file with the `--web` argument it will automatically generate an accompanying html file and serve it up for your browser.\n\n* `--target [targets]`\n\n    Specify the target environment(s). When running, imba will automatically target your local node version.\n\n\n## imba build *&#91;options&#93; &#91; script &#93;* [cli] [ultable] [h2]\n\nThe `imba build` command takes care of building your project for production.  In addition to all options from `imba`, `imba build` takes the following options:\n\n* `-o, --outdir [dir]`\n    \n    Specify the output directory (relative to project root). Defaults to `dist`\n\n* `-k, --keep`\n\n    Once installed, you have access to the `imba` command, which can execute scripts, serve files for development, and build projects for production.\n\n## imba serve *&#91;options&#93; &#91; entry.imba | entry.html &#93;* [cli] [ultable] [h2]\n\nConvenieve command for quickly serving up a script or an html page with an accompanying dev server with HMR and automatic reloading.

Components are _just like regular classes_ and uses all the same syntax to declare properties, methods, getters and setters. To create a component, use the keyword `tag` followed by a component name.\n\n```imba app.imba\n# [preview=md]\nimport {Draggable} from './draggable'\n\ntag App\n    <self[inset:0 d:hflex ja:center]>\n        <Draggable[hue:blue]> 'One'\n\t\t<Draggable[hue:sky]> 'Two'\n        <Draggable[hue:indigo]> 'Three'\n        <Draggable[hue:purple]> 'Four'\n\nimba.mount <App>\n```\n\n```imba draggable.imba\nexport tag Draggable\n\tcss pos:relative d:flex ja:center\n\t\trd:md bg:hue3 c:gray9/70 \n\t\tw:24 h:10 m:1 px:4 fs:sm\n        cursor:grab\n\n\tprop x = 0\n\tprop y = 0\n\n\t<self[x:{x}px y:{y}px] @touch.moved.sync(self)> <slot> \"box\"\n```\n\n\n### Global Components\n```imba\ntag app-component\n    # add methods, properties, ...\n```\nComponents with lowercased names containing at least two words separated by a dash are compiled directly to global [native Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). These components are registered globally and are available anywhere in your project (as long as the file has been imported at least once).\n\n\n### Local Components\n```imba\nexport tag AppComponent\n\t# methods, properties, ...\n```\nComponents whose name begins with an uppercase letter are considered local components. They act just like web components, but are not registered globally, and must be exported + imported from other files to be used in your project. Very useful when you want to define custom components that are local to a subsystem of your application.\n\n## Rendering content\n\n## Named Elements [preview=md]\n\nIt can be useful to keep references to certain child elements inside a component. This can be done using `<node$reference>` syntax.\n\n```imba\nimport 'util/styles'\n\n# ---\ntag app-panel\n    <self.group>\n        <button @click=($name.value += 'Hi')> \"Write\"\n        <input$name type='text'>\n# ---\n\nimba.mount <app-panel>\n```\n\nIn the code above, `$name` is available everywhere inside `app-panel` component, but also from outside the app-panel as a property of the component.\n\n## Declaring Attributes [wip]",

          "body": "# Control Flow\n\n## For-In Loops\n\nFor in is the basic syntax for looping through arrays and any other object that has a `length` property and allows accessing their members through `object[index]`. This includes `Array`, `NodeList`, `DOMTokenList`, `String` and more. It was created before `for of` iterables became standard in ES2015, but is still a practical alternative to using `for of` in many cases. Imba `for in` is not to be confused with `for in` [in javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in).\n\n```imba\nfor num in [1,2,3]\n    num * 2\n```\n\n### Index parameter\n\nIf you include a second parameter in the source it will automatically refer to the index of the current iteration.\n\n```imba\nfor num,index in [1,2,3]\n    console.log num * index\n# => [1,4,9]\n```\n\n### Stepping with `by`\n\nTo step through an iterable in fixed-size chunks, use `by`\n\n```imba\n# go through every other element\nfor num in [1,2,3] by 2\n    num * 2\n```\n\n### Filtering with `when`\n\nYou can include a condition using the `when` clause. This will make sure the iteration only executes for members that match said condition.\n\n```imba\n# go through every other element\nfor num,i in [1,2,3] when i % 2\n    console.log num\n```\n\n### For-In with ranges\n\n```imba\n# from 0 up to (including) 3\nfor num in [0 .. 3]\n    num\n# => [0,1,2,3]\n```\n\n```imba\n# from 0 up to (excluding) 3\nfor num in [0 ... 3]\n    num\n# => [0,1,2]\n```\n\n> Ranges **must include spaces** around `..` and `...`\n\n### For-In with non-arrays\n\nWhen Imba cannot infer that an object is an array during compilation it will behind the scenes look for a `toIterable` method on the object before looping. This way one can make any type of object easily support being iterated using a `for in` loop.\n\n```imba\nclass LabelString\n    def constructor label\n        label = label\n\n    def toIterable\n        console.log 'called toIterable'\n        label.split(',')\n\nlet labels = new LabelString 'idea,proposal,duplicate'\n\nfor label in labels\n    console.log label.toUpperCase!\n```\n\n## For-Of Loops\n\nThe for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects, including: built-in String, Array, array-like objects (e.g., arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. This maps directly to `for of` [in javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) with a few convenient additions.\n\n### Iterating over an `Array` [preview=console]\n\n```imba\nlet iterable = [10,20,30]\nfor value of iterable\n    console.log value\n```\n\n### Iterating over a `String` [snippet] [preview=console]\n\n```imba\nlet iterable = 'imba'\nfor value of iterable\n    console.log value\n```\n\n### Iterating over a `TypedArray` [snippet] [preview=console]\n\n```imba\nlet iterable = new Uint8Array([0x00,0xff])\nfor value of iterable\n    console.log value\n```\n\n### Iterating over a `Map` [snippet] [preview=console]\n\n```imba\nlet iterable = new Map([['a',1],['b',2],['c',3]])\nfor entry of iterable\n    console.log entry\n\n# destructuring\nfor [key,value] of iterable\n    console.log value\n```\n\n### Iterating over a `Set` [snippet] [preview=console]\n\n```imba\nlet iterable = new Set([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3])\nfor value of iterable\n    console.log value\n```\n\n### Iterating over the arguments object [snippet] [preview=console]\n\n```imba\ndef fn\n    for arg of arguments\n        arg * 2\nconsole.log fn(1,2,3) # => [2,4,6]\n```\n\n### Iterating with index parameter\n\nIn Imba you can supply a second parameter to `for ... of`. This will be populated with the current iteration number (starting at 0), just like the second argument in `Array#map` and `Array#forEach`.\n\n```imba\nlet iterable = new Map([['a',1],['b',2],['c',3]])\nfor entry,idx of iterable\n    console.log entry,idx\nfor [key,value],idx of iterable\n    console.log key,value,idx\n```\n\n\n### For-Own-Of\n\nA pretty common need is to loop through the key-value pairs of objects. The default recommended way to do this in JavaScript is:\n\n```javascript\nlet obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };\nfor (const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj)) {\n\tconsole.log(`${key}: ${value}`);\n}\n```\n\nSince this is a common pattern - Imba has specific support for this using `for own ... of`. This statement creates a loop iterating over key-value pairs of objects.\n\n```imba\nlet obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}\nfor own key,value of obj\n    console.log \"{key} is {value}\"\n```\n\n## While Loops\n\nExecutes repeatedly as long as condition is truthy.\n\n```imba\nlet ary = [1,2,3]\nwhile let item = ary.pop!\n    console.log item\n```\n\n## Until Loops\n\nExecutes repeatedly **until** condition is truthy.\n\n```imba\nlet ary = [1,2,3]\nuntil ary.length == 0\n    console.log ary.pop!\n```\n\n## Continue\n\n`continue` is supported in all loop types (`for in`, `for of` and `for own of`)\n\n```imba\nlet res = for num in [1,2,3,4,5]\n    continue if num == 3\n    num * 2\nconsole.log res # [2,4,8,10]\n```\n\n```imba\nlet res = for num in [1,2,3,4,5]\n    break if num == 3\n    num * 2\n# => [2,4]\n```\n\n### Continue with value\n\nWhen supplying an argument to continue, this value will be added to the resulting array, essentially like an early return would do in an `Array#map` function.\n\n```imba\nlet res = for num in [1,2,3,4,5]\n    continue -1 if num == 3\n    num * 2\n# continue with an argument acts like early return within Array#map\n# => [2,4,-1,8,10]\n```\n\n## Break\n\n`break` is supported in all loop types (`for in`, `for of` and `for own of`)\n\n```imba\nlet res = for num in [1,2,3,4,5]\n    break if num == 3\n    num * 2\n# => [2,4]\n```\n\n### Break with value\n\nYou can also supply an argument to break. When supplying an argument to break, this value will be added to the resulting array. This is especially useful when you want to return until some condition is met, but also want to include the item at which condition was met.\n\n```imba\nlet res = for num in [1,2,3,4,5]\n    break -1 if num == 3\n    num * 2\n```\n\n## Conditionals\n\n### If [snippet]\n\nThe if statement executes the indented code if a specified condition is truthy.\n\n```imba\n# indented\nif condition\n    console.log 'yes!'\n```\n\n### Unless [snippet]\n\nThe unless statement executes the indented code if a specified condition is _not_ truthy.\n\n```imba\nunless condition\n    console.log 'condition was not truthy'\n```\n\n> The unless statement executes the indented code if a specified condition is _not_ truthy.\n\n### Else [snippet]\n\nIf the condition is falsy, code inside the connected else block will execute.\n\n```imba\nif condition\n    console.log 'yes!'\nelse\n    console.log 'no!'\n```\n\n### Chaining conditionals [snippet]\n\nTo conveniently chain multiple conditionals, use `elif`. No `elif` or `else` statements will be executed after the first truthy condition.\n\n```imba\nif expr > 10\n    console.log 'over 10'\nelif expr > 5\n    console.log 'over 5'\nelif expr\n    console.log 'not falsy'\n```\n\n### Trailing condition [snippet]\n\nIf & unless can also be used at the end of a single line expression\n\n```imba\nconsole.log 'yes' if condition\nconsole.log 'no' unless condition\n```\n\n### Ternary operator [snippet]\n\nThe [Ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) is a useful way to write compact if / else statements.\n\n```imba\ncondition ? console.log('yes!') : console.log('no!')\n```\n\n## Switch\n\n```imba\nswitch value\n    when 10\n        yes\n    when 5\n        no\n    else\n        throw 'nope'\n```\n\n## Await\n\nImba supports the `await` keyword, which compiles directly to async/await in JavaScript. The only difference is that you do not need to mark your functions as async. Any function that contains an await will automatically be compiled to an async function.\n\n```imba await.imba\ndef load url\n    let res = await window.fetch url\n    return res.json\n\nlet data = await load \"/some/url\"\n```\n\n#### Without await using promises\n```imba\ndef load url\n    window.fetch(url).then do(res)\n        return res.json\n\nload(\"/some/url\").then do(data)\n    # do something with data\n```\n\n> async/await is already supported in every major browser. If you are targeting IE11 users you need to babelify the compiled code.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nFor error handling you can throw exceptions using the `throw` statement and handle them using the `try` and `catch` statements. Adding a `try` without a `catch` block will silently swallow the error.\n\n```imba app.imba\ndef run\n    # adding a try without a catch block will silently swallow an error\n    let test = try Math.rEndom!\n    return test # returns undefined as Math.rEndom! is not a function\nconsole.log run! # undefined\n```\n\n```imba\ndef parse input\n    try\n        return JSON.parse input\n    catch e\n        console.error \"Invalid json passed to parser: \", e.message\n\nparse('<invalid json, error here we come!>')\n```\n> Invalid json passed to parser:  Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0\n",

          "body": "# Declarative Rendering\n\nThe virtual DOM was a fantastic innovation. It brought about a much more productive way of writing web applications by allowing us to write our views in a declarative manner. Declarative rendering is only possible if the process of re-rendering is fast enough. To do this, virtual DOMs essentially render a lightweight representation of your view, compares it to the previous lightweight representation, and only *patch* the real DOM with the changes.\n\nThis process is still quite slow, and to work around these inherent challenges we've resorted to complex state management frameworks that carefully track the changing data, making sure that only specific views need to re-render. Even with this in place, rendering complex lists and very dynamic views can often become sluggish. What if we could get better performance in a world where the data layer and view layer don’t really know or care about each other?\n\nImba introduces a *revolutionary* new way of reconciling your dom which is orders of magnitutes faster than existing virtual DOM approaches. Understanding the basic concepts is invaluable to get a deep understanding of how to make things with Imba.\n\n## How it Works\n\nDOM nodes in Imba are *not* virtual, they are in fact real elements:\n\n```imba\nlet el = <div.large title=\"Item\">\nconsole.log el # HTMLDivElement\nconsole.log el.outerHTML # <div class='large' title='Item'>\n```\n\nLet's look at a simple component and go through the generated code line by line. \n\n```imba\nlet number = 1\nlet bool = false\n\ntag App\n\t<self .ready=bool>\n\t\t<h1.header> \"Number is {number}\"\n\n```\n\nThe component above will roughly compile to something like the following. Feel free to skip this part if it seems hard to understand, but please get back to it. Once you get a deep understand the simple yet powerful way Imba does rendering it will make you a much more powerful developer.\n\n```js\n/*\nThis is handcrafted pseudocode – the real imba output is\nmore optimised and compact, making it a little harder to\nunderstand.\n*/\nlet number = 1;\nlet bool = false;\n\nclass App extends HTMLImbaElement {\n\trender(){\n\t\tvar $ = (this.cache || this.cache = {});\n\t\t\n\t\t// toggle the class name on the App element - based on\n\t\t// value of bool, and cache the valua for later checks\n\t\tif($.val != bool) this.classList.toggle('ready',$.val = bool)\n\n\t\tif(!$.rendered){\n\t\t\t$.h1 = this.appendChild('h1') // add h1 and cache element\n\t\t\t$.h1.className = \"header\"; // only on first render\n\t\t\t$.h1.insertText(\"Number is \"); // only on first render\n\t\t\t$.t1 = h1.insertText(number); // add text and cache textnode\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t// has been rendered previously, not much to do!\n\t\t\t$.t1.textContent = number; // update the text of the textnode\n\t\t}\t\t\n\t\t$.rendered = true; // mark App as rendered\n\t\t// nothing is returned from render\n\t}\n};\n```\n\nTry to read this code, and figure out what will happen the first time `app.render()` is called, and what will happen the second time.\n\nIn a framework like react, the idea is that the render method creates a virtual dom tree *and returns it*. Every time you call render it will generate a new tree. This tree will be taken by the dom reconciler to compare to some previously cached version, create a diff, and patch the real DOM with the changes.\n\nIn Imba, calling render will *actually* create and then later modify the *real* DOM elements to make sure they appear the way you have declared. So after the first render, calling render on the `App` element above will only run a minimal number of instructions. The result is that re-rendering in Imba is so fast that you can literally render your whole application, from root, regularly.\n\n### Basic example\n\n```imba main.imba\nglobal css body d:flex ja:center\n# ---\nlet number = 1\ntag App\n\t<self>\n\t\t<h1.header> \"Number is {number}\"\n\ndocument.body.appendChild <App>\n```\n\nHere we created an `<App>` element and added it to the body. As you can see, it prints the text as it should, but if the number changes, it will still read \"Number is 1\" in the DOM. Now let's add some methods to see if we can re-render:\n\n```imba main.imba\n# [footer] [preview=md]\nglobal css body d:flex ja:center\n# ---\nlet number = 1\ntag App\n\t<self>\n\t\t<h1.header> \"Number is {number}\"\n\nlet el = <App>\ndocument.body.appendChild el\n\nexport def update\n\tnumber = Math.random!\n\tel.render! # call render manually\n# ---\nexport const actionzs = {\n\t\"number += 1\": do\n\t\tnumber += 1\n\t\tconsole.log \"incremented number to {number}\"\n\t\"el.render()\": do el.render!\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, whenever we call `render` on the element it makes sure to update the dom if anything has changed. Also, when render is called on an element, all the custom children will also be re-rendered:\n\n```imba main.imba\n# [footer] [preview=lg]\nglobal css body d:flex ja:center\n# ---\ntag Item\n\tcss d:block px:1 m:1 bg:blue2 fs:sm rd:md\n\t<self> \"Changes on every render: {Math.random!}\"\n\t\t\ntag App\n\t<self>\n\t\t<Item>\n\t\t<Item>\n\ndocument.body.appendChild let el = <App>\n# ---\nexport const actions = {\n\t\"el.render\": do el.render!\n}\n```\n\n## Automatic rendering\n\nCalling render manually on your elements is cumbersome and doesn't really scale. Instead, imba automatically calls render on your mounted elements whenever an event has been triggered *and* handled by a listener. The only thing you need to do is to add your root element using `imba.mount` instead of `document.body.appendChild`.\n\n```imba\n# [preview=xl]\nimport 'util/styles'\n\ncss div pos:absolute d:block inset:0 p:4\ncss mark pos:absolute\ncss li d:inline-block px:1 m:1 rd:2 fs:xs bg:gray1 @hover:blue2\n# ---\nlet x = 20\nlet y = 20\nlet title = \"Hey\"\n# mount our elements via imba.mount\nimba.mount do\n    <main @mousemove=(x=e.x,y=e.y)>\n        <input bind=title>\n        <label> \"Mouse is at {x} {y}\"\n        <mark[x:{x} y:{y} rotate:{x / 360}]> \"Item\"\n        <ul> for nr in [0 ... y]\n            <li> nr % 12 and nr or title\n```\nMove your mouse around and see how everything updates instantly. This is just a tiny preview of how fast and powerful the declarative rendering in Imba is. Because we listen to a `@mousemove` event, Imba will automatically call render on the mounted element.\n\n## Manual rendering\n\nThe default approach of Imba is to re-render the mounted application after every handled DOM event. If a handler is asynchronous (using await or returning a promise), Imba will also re-render after the promise is finished. Practically all state changes in applications happen as a result of some user interaction.\n\nIn the few occasions where you need to manually make sure views are updated, you can call `imba.commit`. This is also what the event handlers are using under the hood. It schedules an update for the next animation frame. It returns a promise that resolves after the actual updates are completed, which is practical when you need to ensure that the view is in sync before doing something. Things will only be rerendered once even if you call `imba.commit` a thousand times.\n\nManually calling `imba.commit` is usually only needed when dealing with receiving data asynchronously (not as a result of a user interaction / event). So, if you receive data via a websocket, the only thing you need to make your whole application magically stay in sync with your data is to call imba.commit whenever you receive data from your socket.\n\n```imba\nwebsocket.addEventListener('message',imba.commit)\n```\n\nOr, if you fetch some data via window.fetch, and it doesnt happen asynchronously as part of an event handler, just make sure to call `imba.commit` afterwards:\n\n```imba\ndef load\n    let res = await window.fetch(\"/items\")\n    state.items = await res.json!\n    imba.commit!\n```\n\n## Custom scheduling\n\nLet's say you have a clock, or some other element that needs to re-render at specific intervals, or more often than the rest of your app. Remember, the only thing that really happens when we render is that `.render()` is called on elements. So, manually you could add an interval to specific elements:\n\n```imba\n# [preview=md]\nimport 'util/styles'\n# ---\ntag Clock\n    css d:block p:2 bd:1px solid gray4 m:2 ta:center\n    def mount   do #interval = setInterval(render.bind(self),1000)\n    def unmount do clearInterval(#interval)\n    def render  do <self> <span> (new Date).toLocaleString!\n\nimba.mount do\n    <div @click.log('clicked')>\n        <span> \"Rendered on click {Math.random!}\"\n        <Clock>\n```\nAs you can see, the clock is actually updating every second. It is a little cumbersome to setup and teardown the intervals though, and since this is a pretty common pattern, Imba has a better way to do this, using the `autorender` property.\n\n```imba\n# [preview=md]\nimport 'util/styles'\n# ---\ntag Clock\n    css d:block p:2 bd:1px solid gray4 m:2 ta:center\n    <self> <span> (new Date).toLocaleString!\n\nimba.mount do\n    <div @click.log('clicked')>\n        <span> \"Rendered on click {Math.random!}\"\n        <Clock autorender=1s>\n```\n\nLet's create some proper clocks, and show a few autorender values:\n\n```imba\n# [preview=xl]\nimport 'util/styles'\nglobal css body d:block\n# ---\ntag app-clock\n\tprop utc\n\t\n\tdef render\n\t\tlet ts = Date.now! / 60000 + utc * 60\n\t\t<self.clock>\n\t\t\t<div.dial.h[rotate:{ts / 720}]> <i>\n\t\t\t<div.dial.m[rotate:{ts / 60}]> <i>\n\t\t\t<div.dial.s[rotate:{ts}]> <i/> <b>\n\nimba.mount do\n    <div.clocks>\n        <app-clock autorender=1s title='New York' utc=-5>\n        <app-clock autorender=500ms title='San Fran' utc=-8>\n        <app-clock autorender=10fps title='London' utc=0>\n        <app-clock autorender=60fps title='Tokyo' utc=9>\n```",

See methods.\n\n## Defining functions\n\n```imba\n# defining a function\nconst square = do(num) num * num\n\n# inside an object\nconst util =\n    upcase: do(str) str.toUpperCase!\n    downcase: do(str) str.toLowerCase!\n```\n\nFunction scopes are selfless, meaning that `self` inside their function bodies will refer to the closest lexical _selfish_ scope. See more about this in the section on Scoping.\n\n### Default parameters\n\n```imba\nconst multiply = do(a, b = 1)\n    a * b\n```\n\n### Rest parameters\n\n```imba\ndef add num, ...rest\n    for item in rest\n        num += item\n    return num\n\nadd 1,2,3,4,5\n```\n\n### Destructuring parameters\n\n```imba\ndef draw {size = 'big', coords = {x:0, y:0}, radius = 25}\n\tconsole.log size,coords,radius\n\ndraw coords:{x: 18, y:30}, radius:30\n```\n\n## Calling functions\n\nDefining a function does not execute it. Defining it simply names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called. Accessing a function does not execute it either. If an object has a property `transform`, `object.transform` merely references that function.\n\nWhen you call a function with arguments, parenthesis are optional.\n\n```imba\n# the following expressions are equivalent\nconsole.log('hello')\nconsole.log 'hello'\n```\n\nIf you want to call a function without arguments, you have two options. Either with an empty pair of parenthesis, or with a `!`, which we call _bang invocation_ in Imba.\n\n```imba\n# the following expressions are equivalent\nMath.random()\nMath.random!\n```\n\n### Callbacks\n\nMany functions expect another function as an argument. These are often referred to as callbacks. To take a classic example, `Array.map` creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element.\n\nSince this is a common pattern, inline anonymous functions can be passed in\n\n```imba\n[1,2,3].map do(item)\n    item * 2 # [2,4,6]\n```\n\nThe convention is usually to take the callback as the last argument, but not always.\n\n```imba\nsetTimeout((do\n    console.log 'waited!'\n    [1,2,3].reduce((do(sum,value)\n        sum + value\n    ),0)\n),1500) # looks pretty messy\n```\n\nWhen functions expect callbacks as their first (or not-last) argument, you can use `&` as a placeholder for the callback. The `&` is simply a reference to the callback that is supplied at the end of the invocation.\n\n```imba\nsetTimeout(&,1500) do\n    console.log 'waited!'\n    [1,2,3].reduce(&,0) do(sum, value)\n        sum + value\n```",

Unlike javascript, multiple declarations per line is not allowed.\n\n```imba\n# readonly constant\nconst one = 123\n\n# single declaration\nlet a = 123\n\n# array destructuring\nlet [e,f,...rest] = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\n# object destructuring\nlet {g,h,data:i} = {g:1,h:2,data:3}\n\n# in conditionals\nif let user = array.find(do $1 isa Person)\n\tyes\n```\n\n> [tip box yellow] In all the examples throughout this documentation you can hover over an identifier to highlight all references to the variable. Identifiers resolving to variables have a different color than identifiers resolving as implicit accessors of self.\n\n## Scoping\n\n### Lexical Scopes\n\n`if`, `elif`, `else`, `do`, `for`,`while`,`until`,`switch`,`do` create block scopes. This means that any variable declared in the indented code inside these statements are only available within that scope.\n\n```imba\n# global scope\nlet x = 1\nif true\n\t# block scope\n\tlet y = 2\ny # not a variable in scope\n```\n\n### This vs Self\n\nIf you come from js, `this` will be a well-known concept. While `this` still exists, working exactly like its js counterpart, `self` is what you should use in imba. It is a very common pattern in js to need to refer to an outer scope when dealing with callbacks, event listeners and more.\n\n```javascript\nsetup(){\n\tvar self = this;\n\t[1,2,3].map(function(){\n\t\tself.doSomething();\n\t})\n}\n```\n\nThis is essentially what `self` does under the hood. In imba, `self` is bound do the closest _selfish_ scope. Besides the root scope of a file, only the scopes of `def`, `get` and `set` are selfish.\n\n```imba\nclass Item\n\tdef setup\n\t\t# selfish scope\n\t\t[1,2,3].map do |val|\n\t\t\t# selfless scope\n\t\t\tself # the Item\n\t\t\tthis # the array\n```\n\nIf this looks confusing, fear not – `this` is something you will practically never see or use in imba codebases.\n\n### Implicit Self\n\nImba uses the concept of implicit self. A lone, lowercase identifier will always be treated as an accessor on `self` unless a variable of the same name exists in the current scope or any of the outer scopes.\n\n```imba\nconst scale = 1\nclass Rectangle\n    def check forced\n        forced # found variable named arg - no implicit self\n        scale # found in scope! - no implicit self\n        width # no variable - equivalent to self.width\n        normalize! # not found - method call on self\n\n```\n\nSelf is also implicit when setting properties.\n\n```imba\nlet changes = 0\nclass Line\n    def expand\n        changes += 1 # changes += 1\n        width += 10 # self.width += 10\n```\n\nSelf always refers to the closest _selfish_ scope, and lone identifiers not declared in the lexical scope are treated as properties on self. **Uppercased identifiers are not treated as accessors**. So `Array`, `Map`, or `SomeIdentifier` will always resolve the same way they do in JavaScript.\n\n### Global variables [wip]\n\n<!-- Mention the globals. -->\n\n### Variable hoisting\n\nVariables are _not_ hoisted in Imba. This means that a reference to a variable before its declaration will behave is if there is no declaration - and instead be an implicit access on self.\n\n```imba\ndef method\n\tdata # not in scope - same as self.data\n\tlet data = {a:1,b:2}\n\tdata # in scope\n```\n\n## Identifiers\n\nIn imba, identifiers are case-sensitive and can contain Unicode letters, `$`, `_`, `-`, and digits (`0-9`), but may *not* start with a digit. \n\nAn identifier can end with `?` to make it a predicate identifier, thus helping make clear that the value should resolve to a boolean `get empty? do !array.length`. See [Predicate filters](#identifiers-predicate-identifiers)\n\n`$0 .. $n` are reserved identifiers used as shorthands for function arguments with $0 refering to the set of arguments. See [Identifiers with special meanings](#identifiers-identifiers-with-special-meanings)\n\nLike css and html, dashes inside identifiers are perfectly valid in Imba and is often preferred for readability and that it allows to easily skip to each segment of the identifier. They are compiled to use the greek symbol Ksi `Ξ` in javascript to be valid but avoid conflict. \n\n### Predicate Identifiers\n\nImba also allows `?` at the end of identifiers for methods, properties, and variables. These are predicate identifiers  and should represent a boolean value. They are used to represent a checkable state and provides improved readability over other approaches like predicate prefixes like `isEmpty`.\n\n```imba\ntag sized-list\n    prop items = []\n    prop size = 10\n\n    get empty? do !items.length\n```\n\n### Identifiers with special meanings\n\nThere are a few identifiers that are reserved as keywords in certain contexts. `get`, `set` and `attr` are perfectly valid to use as variables, arguments, and properties, but in class definitions they have a special meaning.\n\nAlso, identifiers `$0`, `$1`, `$2` and so forth are not valid variables names – as they refer to the nth argument in the current function. `$0` is an alias for `arguments` from js, and refers to all the arguments passed into a function.\n\n```imba\n# $(n) is a shorter way to reference known arguments\n['a','b','c','d'].map do $1.toUpperCase!\n['a','b','c','d'].map do(item) item.toUpperCase!\n```\n\n### Global Identifiers\n\nIdentifiers starting with an uppercase letter are global-first, meaning that they will not be implicitly scoped.\n\n> Example showing global identifiers vs local identifiers\n\n### Symbol Identifiers [wip]\n\n[Symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) are values that programs can create and use as property keys without risking name collisions. In Imba symbol identifiers start with one or more `#` in the beginning of the identifier. So `#name` is a type of identifier representing a symbol. Symbol identifiers are not allowed as variable names, and are always scoped to the closest strong scope.\n\n```imba\nconst obj = {name: 'Jane', #clearance: 'high'}\nobj.name\nobj.#clearance\n```\n\n### Using reserved keywords\n\nEssentially all reserved keywords can still be used as properties.\n\n```imba\na.import\na['import']\na = { import: 'test' }\n```",

See [Predicate filters](#identifiers-predicate-identifiers)\n\n`$0 .. $n` are reserved identifiers used as shorthands for function arguments with $0 refering to the set of arguments. See [Identifiers with special meanings](#identifiers-identifiers-with-special-meanings)\n\n## Dashed Identifiers\nDashes inside identifiers are perfectly valid in Imba and is often preferred for readability and that it allows to easily skip to each segment of the identifier.\n\n```imba\nlet my-dashed-var = yes\nlet object = {dashed-key: 1, other-key: 2}\n\nclass Item\n    prop full-name\\string\n\n    def rename new-name\n        full-name = new-name\n```\n\nThe only caveat to look out for is that the subtraction operator has to be spaced:\n```imba\nlet number = 100\nlet wrong = number-items.length # wrong!\nlet right = number - items.length # right!\n```\n\n> [amber] Dashes in identifiers are converted to the greek symbol Ksi `Ξ` when compiled to js.\n\n## Predicate Identifiers\n\nImba also allows `?` at the end of identifiers for methods, properties, and variables. These are called predicate identifiers and should always represent boolean values. They are used to represent a checkable state and provides improved readability over other approaches like predicate prefixes like `isEmpty`.\n\n```imba\ntag sized-list\n    prop items = []\n    prop size = 10\n\n    get empty?\n        !items.length\n```\n\nUsing these types of identifiers is entirely optional, and may feel weird initially.\n\n> [tip] In JavaScript, optional chaining uses the `?.` operator. For optional chaining in Imba, use `..` like `object..some..key`\n\n## Meta Properties\n\nIdentifiers that start with with one or more `#` are called meta properties in Imba. Meta properties are implemented as [symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol). They do not show up on an Object using `for in`, `for of`, `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` or `Object.keys`, and they will never conflict with string-based / plain properties on your classes & instances.\n\n```imba\nconst user = {name: 'Jane', #clearance: 'high'}\nuser.name # => Jane\nuser.#clearance # => high\nJSON.stringify(user) # => {\"name\": \"Jane\"}\n```\n\nThese properties are especially useful for adding metadata (hence the name) to objects without risking collisions or altering the `public` appearance of the objects. They are used extensively in the imba runtime itself, to extend Element and other core interfaces without fear of conflicts with JS frameworks and libraries.\n\nTo access the symbol of a meta property you can call `Symbol.for(\"#mymetaprop\")`.\n\n```imba\nconst user = {name: 'Jane', #clearance: 'high'}\nuser.#clearance # => high\nuser[Symbol.for('#clearance')] # => high\n```\n\n\n## Argument Identifiers\n\nIdentifiers `$0`, `$1`, `$2` and so forth are not valid variable names – as they refer to the nth argument in the current function. `$0` is an alias for `arguments` from js, and refers to all the arguments passed into a function.\n\n```imba\n# $(n) is a shorter way to reference known arguments\n['a','b','c','d'].map do $1.toUpperCase!\n['a','b','c','d'].map do(item) item.toUpperCase!\n```\n\n## Global Identifiers\n\nIdentifiers starting with an uppercase letter are global-first, meaning that they will not be implicitly scoped.\n\n> Example showing global identifiers vs local identifiers\n\n\n## Reserved Identifiers\n\nThere are a few identifiers that are reserved as keywords in certain contexts. `get`, `set` and `attr` are perfectly valid to use as variables, arguments, and properties, but in class definitions they have a special meaning. Essentially all reserved keywords can still be used as properties.\n\n```imba\na.import\na['import']\na = { import: 'test' }\n```",

Imba is fast in two ways: Time-saving syntax with built-in tags and styles results in less typing and switching files so you can build things fast. A groundbreaking memoized DOM is an order of magnitude faster than virtual DOM libraries, so you can build fast things.\n\nIn Imba DOM elements _and_ CSS are treated as first-class citizens. DOM elements are compiled to a [memoized DOM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-virtual-dom-is-slow-meet-the-memoized-dom-bb19f546cc52/), which is an [order of magnitude faster](https://somebee.github.io/dom-reconciler-bench/index.html) than today's virtual DOM implementations.\n\n#### Imba At A Glance\n\n- Compiles to Javascript\n\n- Works with Javascript\n\n- Smart, Minimal Syntax\n\n- Built-in Tags & Styles\n\n- Amazing Performance\n\n## Community\n\n#### Discord Server\n\nFor questions and support please use our community chat on\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/mkcbkRw) or our [discourse](https://users.imba.io/).\n\n#### Community Meeting\n\nEveryone is welcome! This is a great place to report your issues, hangout and talk about your project using Imba. If you have an open pull request which has not seen attention, you can mention it during the meeting.\n\nFor the exact meeting times please use the Meetup group [Imba Oslo Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Imba-Oslo-Meetup), this is where you can see the timezone, cancellations, etc.\n\nYou can join us remotely via [Zoom](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/230170873).\n\nDid you miss a meeting? No worries, catch up via the [meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ABGjOJut9eXrajYjdN4G4-UGGU4gvKznLk5CAaXYjso/edit?usp=sharing) or [video recordings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf1a9PYKGPdl3OMBHV72Oz23eFy9q51jJ).\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Quickstart\n\nThe best way to get started with Imba is to use `npx` to get a brand-new project up and running.\n\n```sh\nnpx imba create my-app\n```\n\nFollow the instructions to complete the fresh install.\n\n### Full example\n\n```sh\nnpx imba create my-app\ncd my-app\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis will create a brand new app using the latest version of Imba and run it with hot reloading. Edit the `/app/client.imba` file to get started.\n\nTo create a build version of the app for deployment, simply run:\n\n```sh\nnpm build\n```\n\n### Useful tools\n\nWe thoroughly recommend using our Visual Studio Code integration which has fantastic tooling when using Imba - including autocomplete for css shortcuts.\n\n- [VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scrimba.vsimba)\n\n### Getting help\n\nIf you run into any issues, you can check out the GitHub repository or come and join us in our friendly Discord chat group.\n\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/imba/imba)\n\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/mkcbkRw)",

          "body": "\n\n# Literal Types\n\nA good way to think of Imba is, \"it’s just Javascript\". Imba compiles directly to readable JavaScript. This means that every native type with all of their methods, properties and behaviour are the exact same. So, strings are just strings, arrays are just arrays etc. Mozilla Developer Network is a great place to look up extensive documentation for these things.\n\n## Strings\n\n```imba\nlet single = 'single quotes'\nlet double = \"double quotes\"\nlet interpolation = \"string has {double}\"\nlet template = `current version is {imba.version}`\n```\n\nImba uses `{}` for string interpolation while JavaScript uses `${}`. If you want interpolated strings with literal curly-braces, remember to escape them with `\\`. Other than that, the String type is identical to String in JavaScript. See documentation at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String).\n\n### Multiline Strings\n\nRegular string literals can be written over multiple lines, but line breaks are ignored.\n\n```imba\nlet string = 'one\ntwo three'\n# => 'onetwo three'\n```\n\nIf you need a string that spans several lines and includes line breaks, use a sequence of characters surrounded by `'''` or `\"\"\"`\n\n```imba\nlet string = '''\nThis string is written\nover multiple lines\n'''\n# => 'This string\\nis written over\\nmultiple lines'\n```\n\nMultiline strings preserves indentation, but only relative to the least indented line:\n\n```imba\nlet string = '''\n    First level is ignored\n        This is indented\n    Not indented\n    '''\n```\n\n### Template Strings\n\n```imba\n`string text`\n# multiple lines\n`string text line 1\n string text line 2`\n# interpolated expression\n`string text {expression} string text`\n# tagged template\nmethod`string text {expression} string text`\n```\n\n### Tagged templates [tip]\n\nTagged templates from JavaScript are on the roadmap, but not currently supported.\n\n### Dimension Strings\n\n```imba\nlet length = 100px\nlet progress = 87%\nlet dynamic = (window.innerWidth)px\n```\nDimensions are numbers with a unit attached to it. They are compiled and treated as regular strings. When dealing with styles it is nice to be able to write `offset = (point.x)px` instead of `offset = \"{point.x}px\"`.\n\nTime-based units `ms`, `s`, and `fps` are compiled to millisecond-based numbers.\n\n```imba\n10s # 10000\n250ms # 250\n5s - 150ms # 4850\n60fps # 16.66666\n```\n\n## Numbers\n\n```imba\nlet integer = 42\nlet float = 42.10\nlet hex = 0x00\nlet binary = 0b0010110\n```\n\nThe Number type is identical to Number in JavaScript. See documentation at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number).\n\n#### Numeric Separators\n\nYou can use `_` as a separator inside numbers for improved readability.\n\n```imba\nlet budget = 120_000_000\nlet spent = 123_150_077.59\nlet hex = 0xA0_B0_C0\nlet binary = 0b0010_1100\n```\n\n#### Numeric Constants\n\n```imba\nconst biggestNum     = Number.MAX_VALUE\nconst smallestNum    = Number.MIN_VALUE\nconst infiniteNum    = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY\nconst negInfiniteNum = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY\nconst notANum        = Number.NaN\n```\n\n#### Durations\n\nNumbers with time units `ms`, `s`, and `fps` are normalised to milliseconds.\n\n```imba\n10s # 10000\n250ms # 250\n5s - 150ms # 4850\n60fps # 16.66666\n```\n\n## Arrays\n\n##### Array Literal\n\n```imba\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nArrays can also be declared over multiple lines, where the value of each line represents an entry in the array. Commas are optional when array elements are separated by line breaks.\n\n```imba\nconst array = [\n    'one'\n    'two'\n    'three'\n    'four'\n]\n```\n\n## Objects\n\n##### Syntax\n\n```imba\nlet object = {a: 'foo', b: 42, c: {}}\nconsole.log(object.a) # => 'foo'\n```\nSet dynamic keys using `[]`\n```imba\nlet field = 'age'\nlet person = {name: 'Bob Smith', [field]: 32, gender: 'male'}\nconsole.log(person.age) # => 32\n```\n\n##### Indented\n\n```imba\nlet person =\n    name: 'Bob Smith'\n    age: 32\n    gender: 'male'\nconsole.log(person.name) # => 'Bob Smith'\n```\n\n##### Dot notation\n\n```imba\nlet person = {name: 'Bob Smith', age: 32, gender: 'male'}\n# ---\nperson.name\nperson.age = 33\n```\n\n##### Bracket notation\n\n```imba\nlet person = {name: 'Bob Smith', age: 32, gender: 'male'}\n# ---\nperson['name']\nperson['age'] = 33\n```\n\n##### Destructuring\n\n```imba\nlet a = 'foo'\nlet b = 42\nlet c = {}\nlet object = {a,b,c}\nconsole.log(object) # => {a: 'foo', b: 42 c: {}}\n```\n\n## Booleans\n\n```imba\nlet bool1 = true\nlet bool2 = yes # alias for true\nlet bool3 = false\nlet bool4 = no # alias for false\n```\n\n## Null\n\n```imba\nlet value = null\n```\n\nThe value `null` represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values and is treated as falsy for boolean operations.\n\n## Undefined\n\nThe global `undefined` property represents the primitive value `undefined`. A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined\n\n### Strict equality\n\nStrict equality syntax in Imba is the same as in Javascript.\n\n```imba\n0 == '0'  # true\n0 === '0' # false\n```\n\n## Regular Expressions\n\nThe RegExp object is used for matching text with a pattern. Read more at [MDN RegExp Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp). For an introduction to regular expressions, read the [Regular Expressions chapter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) on MDN.\n\n##### Literal\n\n```imba\nlet regex = /ab+c/i\n```\n\n##### Constructor\n\n```imba\nlet regex = new RegExp('ab+c', 'i')\n```\n\n##### Multiline\n\n```imba\nlet regex = ///\n    ab+ # allows comments and whitespace\n    c\n///\n```\n\n## Ranges\n\nRanges are written like `[0...10]` and can be used to loop through the specified values\n\n```imba\nresult = \"\"\nfor i in [1...5]\n    result = \"{result}, \"\n\nresult # => 1, 2, 3, 4\n```\n\n## Tags\n\nOne of the most unique features of Imba is that DOM elements are true first-class citizens of the language. Read the [Rendering](/tags/basic-syntax) section to learn all about it.\n\n```imba\nlet myElement = <div.foo title=\"Greetings\"> \"Hello World\"\n```\n\n",

          "body": "# Mounting Elements\n\nThe fact that tag literals generate real dom nodes means that we can add/remove/modify the dom in an imperative way. In theory.\n\n##### [preview=lg]\n\n```imba\n# [preview=lg]\nimport 'util/styles'\n\n# ---\nlet array = [\"First\",\"Second\"]\n\nlet view = <main>\n    <button @click=array.push('More')> 'Add'\n    <ul.list> for item in array\n        <li> item\n\n# view is a real native DOM element\ndocument.body.appendChild view\n```\n\nEven though we rendered a dynamic list of items, it won't update if new items are added to the array or if members of the array change. Clicking the button will actually add items, but our view is clearly not keeping up. What to do?\n\n### imba.mount\n\nTo make the tag tree update when our data changes, we need to add pass the tree to `imba.mount`.\n\n##### [preview=lg]\n\n```imba\nimport 'util/styles'\n\n# ---\nlet array = [\"First\",\"Second\"]\n\nimba.mount do\n    <main>\n        <button @click=array.push('More')> 'Add'\n        <ul.list> for item in array\n            <li> item\n```\n\nNow you will see that when you click the button, our view instantly updates to reflect the new state. How does this happen without a virtual dom? The array is not being tracked in a special way (it is just a plain array), and we are only dealing with real dom elements, which are only changed and updated when there is real need for it. Imba uses a technique we call `memoized dom`, and you can read more about how it works [here](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/the-virtual-dom-is-slow-meet-the-memoized-dom-bb19f546cc52). Here is a more advanced example with more dynamic data and even dynamic inline styles:\n\n##### [preview=lg]\n\n```imba\n# [preview=lg]\nimport 'util/styles'\n\ncss div pos:absolute d:block inset:0 p:4\ncss mark pos:absolute\ncss li d:inline-block px:1 m:1 rd:2 fs:xs bg:gray1 @hover:blue2\n\n# ---\nlet x = 20\nlet y = 20\nlet title = \"Hey\"\n\nimba.mount do\n    <main @mousemove=(x=e.x,y=e.y)>\n        <input bind=title>\n        <label> \"Mouse is at {x} {y}\"\n        <mark[x:{x} y:{y} rotate:{x / 360}]> \"Item\"\n        <ul> for nr in [0 ... y]\n            <li> nr % 12 and nr or title\n```\n\nBy default Imba will **render your whole application whenever anything _may_ have changed**. Imba isn't tracking anything. This sounds insane right? Isn't there a reason for all the incredibly complex state management libraries and patterns that track updates and wraps your data in proxies and all that? As long as you have mounted your root element using `imba.mount` you usually don't need to think more about it.\n\n### imba.commit\n\nThe default approach of Imba is to re-render the mounted application after every handled DOM event. If a handler is asynchronous (using await or returning a promise), Imba will also re-render after the promise is finished. Practically all state changes in applications happen as a result of some user interaction.\n\nIn the few occasions where you need to manually make sure views are updated, you should call `imba.commit`. It schedules an update for the next animation frame, and things will only be rerendered once even if you call `imba.commit` a thousand times. It returns a promise that resolves after the actual updates are completed, which is practical when you need to ensure that the view is in sync before doing something.\n\n##### commit from websocket\n\n```imba\nsocket.addEventListener('message',imba.commit)\n```\n\nCalling `imba.commit` after every message from socket will ensure that your views are up-to-date when your state changes as a result of some socket message.\n\n##### commit after fetching data\n\n```imba\ndef load\n    let res = await window.fetch(\"/items\")\n    state.items = await res.json!\n    imba.commit!\n```",

Learn Imba through fully interactive screencasts:** <https://scrimba.com/learn/imba>\n\nA good way to think of Imba is, \"it’s just JavaScript\". Imba compiles directly to readable JavaScript. This means that every native type with all of their methods, properties and behaviour are the exact same. So, strings are just strings, arrays are just arrays, and so on.\n\n## Community\n\nWe are a small but active community of early Imba users.

          "body": "# Using Router\n\nImba comes with a built-in router that works on both client and server. It requires no setup and merely introduces the [route](api://Element.route) and [route-to](api://Element.route-to) properties on elements. The router for your \napplication is always available via [imba.router](api://imba.router).\n\n```imba app.imba\n# [preview=lg] [titlebar] [route=/home]\nimport './styles.imba'\nimport './about.imba'\n\ntag App\n    <self>\n        <nav>\n            <a route-to='/home'> \"Home\"\n            <a route-to='/about'> \"About\"\n            <a href='/more'> \"More\"\n\n        <div route='/home'> \"Welcome\"\n        <about-page route='/about'>\n        <div route='/more'> \"More...\"\n\nimba.mount <App.app>\n```\n\n```imba about.imba\ntag about-page < main\n    <self>\n        <aside>\n            <a route-to=\"team\"> \"Team\"\n            <a route-to=\"contact\"> \"Contact\"\n        <section>\n            <div route=''> \"Stuff about us. Click the links to the right\"\n            <div route='team'> \"Our team\"\n            <div route='contact'> \"Contact us at\"\n```\n\n```imba styles.imba\nimport 'util/styles'\n# ---\nglobal css @root\n    # links using route-to gets an .active flag when the\n    # route is matching\n    a.active td:none c:gray8\n    aside fl:0 0 120px d:vflex j:flex-start px:2 bdr:gray3 fs:sm\n    main d:hflex ac:stretch\n    section fl:1\n```\n\nAs you can see with the `More` link, regular links with `href` attributes will also be intercepted by the router. The difference is that [route-to](api://Element.route-to) adds some powerful features like nested routes (see below), and [route-to](api://Element.route-to) will automatically add an `active` class to the element whenever the route it links to is matching.\n\n## Route matching\n\nWhen using [route](api://Element.route) to determine when components should render, the string you pass to route is a regex pattern which will be tested against the current route. Thus if you have multiple components that match part of the request path, they will all render, as shown in this example:\n\n```imba matching.imba\ntag app\n\t<self>\n\t\t<nav>\n\t\t\t<a route-to=\"/\"> \"Home Page\"\n\t\t\t<a route-to=\"/test\"> \"Test Page\"\n\t\t\t<a route-to=\"/test/inner\"> \"Inner Page\"\n\t\t\n\t\t<home route=\"/\"> # this will render on /, /test, and /test/inner\n\t\t<test route=\"/test\"> # this will renderon /test and /test/inner\n\t\t<inner route=\"/test/inner\"> # this will render on /test/inner\n```\n\nIf you want these to be _exact matches_ only, then you should use `$` at the end of the path, as shown below. This is true for both the [route-to](api://Element.route-to) and [route](api://Element.route) calls:\n\n```imba exact-matching.imba\ntag app\n\t<self>\n\t\t<nav>\n\t\t\t<a route-to=\"/$\"> \"Home Page\"\n\t\t\t<a route-to=\"/test$\"> \"Test Page\"\n\t\t\t<a route-to=\"/test/inner$\"> \"Inner Page\"\n\t\t\n\t\t<home route=\"/$\"> # this will only render on /\n\t\t<test route=\"/test$\"> # this will only render on /test\n\t\t<inner route=\"/test/inner$\"> # this will only render on /test/inner\n```\n\n## Nested Routes\n\nRoutes that do not start with `/` will be treated as nested routes, and resolve relative to the closest parent route. This works for both [route](api://Element.route) and [route-to](api://Element.route-to).\n\n## Dynamic Routes\n\nTo map a url pattern to a component, you can use dynamic segments in your routes. A dynamic segment starts with `:`. So the pattern `/user/:id` with match `/user/1`, `/user/2` etc. You can have multiple dynamic segments in a route, like `/genre/:id/movies/:page`. All segments map to corresponding fields in `route.params`. When using nested routes, even the params from parent routes will be available in `route.params`.\n\n```imba app.imba\n# [preview=lg] [titlebar] [route=/genre/drama]\nimport 'util/styles'\n# ---\nimport {genres} from 'imdb'\n\ntag Genre\n    <self> \"Genre with id {route.params.id}\"\n\ntag App\n    <self>\n        # render links for all genres\n        <nav> for item in genres.top\n            <a route-to=\"/genre/{item.id}\"> item.title\n        <Genre.page route=\"/genre/:id\">\n# ---\nimba.mount <App.app>\n```\n\n## Loading Data\n\nIn the example above, the same `<Genre>` component is used when switching between genres. As you can see, the `id` segment from the route is available via `route.params.id`, and it changes when we switch between genres.\n\nIf you want to do something when the params change you can define a `routed` method on your component. This will be called whenever the route changes, and supply the new params, and a state object that is unique for each matched route, but consistent over time (ie. when navigating back to a previously matched set of params).\n\nIf you load anything asynchronously inside `routed` (using `await`), the component will delay rendering until `routed` has finished.\n\nA nice feature of the imba router is that the `params` of any particular route match are constant. Matching `/genre/:id` with the url `/genre/action` it will always return the same `params` object! This is useful for memoizing data etc. (More documentations and examples of usecases will come before final release)\n\nIn addition to this, `route.state` will always return an object that is unique *per match*, but consistent over time. This is very useful for caching data etc for a `component<->matching-route` combination.\n\n```imba app.imba\n# [preview=lg] [titlebar] [route=/genre/drama]\nimport 'util/styles'\n# ---\nimport {genres} from 'imdb'\n\ntag Genre\n    def routed params, state\n        console.log 'routed',params\n        data = state.genre ||= await genres.fetch(params.id)\n\n    <self[d:vflex o@suspended:0.4]>\n        <div> \"{data.title} has {data.movies.length} movies in top 250\"\n# ---\ntag App\n    <self>\n        <nav> for item in genres.top\n            <a route-to=\"/genre/{item.id}\"> item.title\n        <Genre.page route=\"/genre/:id\">\nimba.mount <App.app>\n```\nAs you can see in the example above, we cache data in the `state` object supplied to `routed`. This will make sure you don't refetch the data when you click on a genre you've seen before.",

          "name": "style-syntax",
          "body": "# Style Syntax\n\n## Selectors\n\n```imba\ncss .btn\n    position: relative\n    display: block\n    background: #b2f5ea\n    padding-left: 4px\n    padding-right: 4px\n\ncss .btn@hover\n    background: #81e6d9\n```\n\nStyles are declared using the `css` keyword. Besides using indentation instead of `{}`, making `;` optional, and using `@pseudo` instead of `:pseudo` it looks like regular css. Line breaks are also optional. The following few snippets might look messy at first glance, but bear with us.\n\n```imba\ncss .btn\n    display:block background:#b2f5ea padding-left:4px padding-right:4px\ncss .btn@hover\n    background: #81e6d9\n```\n\nWe firmly believe that less code is better code, so we have strived to make the styling syntax as concise yet readable as possible. There is a case to be made against short variable names in programming, but css properties are never-changing. Imba provides intuitive abbreviations for oft-used css properties, as well as additional properties covering common usecases:\n\n```imba\ncss .btn\n    d:block pl:4px pr:4px bg:#b2f5ea\ncss .btn@hover\n    bg:#81e6d9\n```\n\nWe also want to make it easy to follow a consistent design system throughout your project while not enforcing a predefined look and feel. Imba provides default (but configurable) colors, fonts, size units and more to help enforce consistency:\n\n```imba\ncss .btn\n    d:block px:1 bg:teal2\ncss .btn@hover\n    bg:teal3\n```\n\nRules can also be written on a single line\n\n```imba\ncss .btn d:block px:1 bg:teal2\ncss .btn@hover bg:teal3\n```\n\nThere are also some patterns that come up again and again in css. Changing a few properties on `hover` or other states, or setting certain dimensions for specific screen sizes etc. Imba got you covered with property modifiers that we will get into later. But to round up, the first block of css here would usually be written like this in Imba:\n\n```imba\ncss .btn d:block px:1 bg:teal2 bg@hover:teal3\n```\n\nThis conciseness comes especially handy when declaring inline styles, which we will come back to later.\n\n\n### Nested Selectors\n\nStyles can also be nested. Everything before the first property on new lines are treated as nested selectors.\n\n```imba\ncss .card\n    display: block\n    background: gray1\n    .title color:blue6 # matches .card .title\n    h2.desc color:gray6 # matches .card h2.title\n    # to scope in on current item use &\n    &.large padding:16px # matches .card.large\n```\n\n### Global Selectors\n\nA problem with CSS is that often end up with tons of globally competing styles spread around numerous files. Changing some styles in one place might affect some seemingly unrelated elements. In Imba it is really easy to declare styles that should only apply to certain parts of your application.\n\nBy default, any style rules declared at the top level of your file using `css selector ...` will only apply to the elements declared inside that file. The `button` style above will only affect literal `button` tags rendered **in the same file**. This means that you can declare styles like this in your file without having to worry about affecting styles in other parts of your application, or even inside nested components that are defined in other files, but used here.\n\n```imba\ncss button\n    position: relative\n    display: block\n    background: #b2f5ea\n\n# rest of file ...\n```\n\nIf you prefix your css declaration with the `global` keyword - the styles will apply globally, and in this example affect all `button` elements in your application. The styles will be included as long as they are required somewhere.\n\n```imba\nglobal css button\n    position: relative\n    display: block\n    background: #b2f5ea\n\n# rest of file ...\n```\n\n## Modifier Syntax [wip]\n\n```imba\n# in selectors\ncss button@hover\n    bg:blue\n# in properties\ncss button\n    bg@hover:blue\n# after properties\ncss button\n    bg:white @hover:whitesmoke @focus:blue\n```\n\n### Pseudo-classes\n\nPseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:active`, ...) from css are supported using an `@` instead of the leading `:`. So the css selector `div:hover` is written as `div@hover` in Imba. In Imba you can also use pseudo-classes directly on properties:\n\n```imba\ncss div\n    opacity:0.9\n    opacity@hover:1\n```\nIf you add a `@pseudoclass:value` on the same line as a regular property, it will set the value of the last property, with the pseudo-class applied:\n\n```imba\ncss div opacity:0.8 @hover:0.9 @focus:1\n```\nIn addition to the default pseudo-classes from css, Imba supports several convenient additions like [@focin](css).\n\n### Pseudo-elements\n\nPseudo-elements (`::marker`, `::selection`, ...) are supported with the same syntax as in css.\n\n```imba\ncss li::marker c:blue4\n```\n\n### Class Modifiers\n\nClasses can also be used as modifiers:\n\n```imba\ncss button c:white bg.primary:blue\n# is the same as\ncss button c:white\n    .primary bg:blue\n```\n\n### Custom Breakpoints\n\nYou can set your own custom pixel breakpoints by specifying any number you want after the `@` or `@!` symbols.\n`@` for min-width, and `@!` for max-width.\n\n```imba\ncss div@700 display:block # -> @media (min-width: 700px)\ncss div@!650 display:none # -> @media (max-width: 650px)\ncss div width:100% @700:80% @1300:1200px\n```\n\n## Scoped Styles [preview=lg]\n\nIf you declare style rules inside `tag` definitions, all the styles will magically only apply to elements inside of this component.\n\n```imba\n# ~preview=lg\n# these are global -- applies to everything in project\n# ---\ntag app-card\n    css fs:sm rd:md d:vflex bg:teal1 c:teal7\n    css .header bg:teal2/50 p:3\n    css .body p:3\n\n    <self>\n        <.header> \"Card Header\"\n        <.body> <p> \"Card Paragraph\"\n\ntag app-root\n    # local styles does not leak into app-card\n    css .header bg:green3 p:4 fw:600\n\n    <self>\n        <.header> \"App Header\"\n        <app-card>\n        <app-card>\n# ---\nimba.mount do <app-root[d:grid gap:4 p:4]>\n```\n\nAny style you declare in a tag declaration will only ever affect the literal tags inside the declaration. You don't need to worry about affecting styles of deeply nested elements that might share the same class names. This is very practical, and allows us to safely use short and descriptive class names like `header`, `footer`, `body`, `content` etc, and use them for styling.\n\n### Inherited styles\n\nScoped styles are also inherited when extending components, which makes it very powerful.\n\n```imba\n# ~preview=lg\nimport 'util/styles'\n# these are global -- applies to everything in project\ncss @root ta:center\n# ---\ntag base-item\n    css d:block m:2 p:3 bg:gray2\n    css h1 fs:lg fw:600 c:purple7\n    <self>\n        <h1> \"Heading\"\n        <p> <slot> \"Description\"\n\ntag pink-item < base-item\n    css bg:pink2\n    css h1 c:pink7\n\ntag custom-item < pink-item\n    <self>\n        <h1> \"Heading\"\n        <p[fw:bold]> <slot> \"Description\"\n        <div> \"Show more...\"\n\nimba.mount do <div>\n    <base-item> \"Base item\"\n    <pink-item> \"Pink item\"\n    <custom-item> \"Custom item\"\n```\n\n### Deep Selectors\n\n```imba\n# ~preview=lg\n# ---\ntag app-item\n    <self> <p> \"Normal\"\n\ntag app-root\n    css p fw:600\n    <self>\n        <div> <p> \"Bold\"\n        <div innerHTML='<p>Normal<p>'>\n        <div> <app-item>\n\n# ---\nimba.mount do <app-root[d:grid gap:4 p:4]>\n```\n\nAs you can see in the example above, the literal `<p>` inside `app-root` is styled by the scoped rule, while the `<p>` inside the nested `<app-item>`, and the `<p>` generated via innerHTML are _not_ styled. There are some cases where you don't want this strict scoping though. Imagine a component that renders markdown or really need to override styles for nested components.\n\nThe `>>>` operator _escapes_ the literal confines of the tag.\n\n```imba\n# ~preview=lg\n# these are global -- applies to everything in project\ntag app-item\n    <self> <p> \"Not bold\"\n# ---\ntag app-root\n    css div p fw:600\n    css div >>> p c:blue6\n\n    <self>\n        <div> <p> \"Literal\"\n        <div> <app-item>\n        <div innerHTML='<p>Generated<p>'>\n# ---\nimba.mount do <app-root[d:grid gap:4 p:4]>\n```\n\nThe `>>` operator styles immediate children, just like the `>` operator, but it also targets non-literal immediate children.\n\n```imba\n# ~preview=lg\n# these are global -- applies to everything in project\ntag app-item\n    <self> <p> \"Nested Paragraph\"\n# ---\ntag app-root\n    css div p fw:600\n    css div >> p c:blue6\n\n    <self>\n        <div> <p> \"Literal\"\n        <div> <app-item>\n        <div innerHTML='<p>Generated<p>'>\n# ---\nimba.mount do <app-root[d:grid gap:4 p:4]>\n```\n\n\n## Inline Styles\n\nYou can add inline styles on any element using `[style-properties]` syntax. Think of this as an inlined anonymous class with a bunch of css properties. Instead of coming up with an arbitrary class name and adding styles somewhere else, you can simply add them to elements directly:\n\n```imba\n<div[position:relative display:flex flex-direction:row padding:2rem]>\n```\n\nThis might look like regular inline styles, but with abbreviations and modifiers they become much more powerful and expressive:\n\n```imba\n# More padding on large screens:\n<div[pos:relative d:flex fld:row p:2 @lg:3]>\n# Darker background color on hover:\n<button[bg:gray2 @hover:gray3]> \"Click me\"\n# Set text color when input is focused:\n<input[color@focus:blue7]>\n```\n\nSince inline styles are essentially anonymous classes, they can also be applied conditionally:\n\n```imba\n# line-through and lighter color if item is done\n<div[p:2 color:green9] [td:s c:gray4]=item.done>\n```\n\n#### Interpolation\n\n\n##### Specifying units\n\nWhen you want to interpolate values with units you can include units after `{expr}` like `{expr}px`,`{expr}%` etc.\n\n```imba\n# ~preview\ncss div p:2 m:2 overflow:hidden min-width:80px\n\n# ---\nlet ptr = {x:0, y:0}\nimba.mount do\n    <section[d:block pos:absolute inset:0] @pointermove=(ptr = e)>\n        <div[bg:indigo2 w:{20 + ptr.x / 5}%]> \"% width\"\n        <div[bg:green2 w:{ptr.x}px]> \"px width\"\n\n```\n\n##### Tip! Set properties directly [tip]\n\nYou can definitely use interpolated values with css variables as well, but it is best to interpolate them directly at the value where you want to use it. This way Imba can include the correct default unit if none is provided and more.\n\n## CSS Variables\n\nVariables can be set and accessed like in regular css\n```imba\ncss div --varname:100px width:var(--varname)\n```\nFor convenience, variables can also be accessed and set with a `$` prefix\n```imba\ncss div $varname:100px width:$varname\n```\n\n\n## Interpolation\n\n\nIt is possible to interpolate dynamic values into styles. This happens efficiently at runtime using css variables behind the scenes. This allows you to even write dynamic styles in a declarative manner. **Interpolation is only supported in inline styles, and style blocks nested inside tags.**\n\n```imba\n# ~preview\ncss div pos:absolute p:3 t:2 l:2\ncss section d:block pos:absolute inset:0 user-select:none\n\n# ---\nlet ptr = {x:0, y:0}\nlet num = 0\nimba.mount do\n    <section @pointermove=(ptr = e) @click=(num++)>\n        <div[bg:teal2 x:{ptr.x} y:{ptr.y} rotate:{ptr.x / 360}]> \"Full\"\n        <div[bg:purple2 x:{ptr.x / 2} y:{ptr.y / 2} rotate:{num / 45}]> \"Half\"\n\n```\n\n## Custom Units\n\nYou can define your own unit that can be used for styling and calculations. The unit can have modifiers like break points and you can use the units in the same way as other css units. The syntax to define a custom unit is `<measure><name>: <value>` e.g. `1col: calc(100vw / 12)`.\n\n```imba custom-unit.imba\nglobal css @root\n    1pad: 25px\n    1col: calc(100vw / 12)\n\ntag app-dialog\n    css \n        # span 12 columns by default,\n        # 6 colums at >768px viewports\n        # and 3 columns on >1280px viewports.\n        width:12col @md:6col @lg:3col\n        p: 1pad\n```\n\n## Keyframes\n\nKeyframes are declared with `css @keyframes name` syntax. They work just like keyframes in css.\n\n```imba\n# to declare an anim available everywhere - use global\nglobal css @keyframes blink\n\t0% c:white\n\t100% c:blue\n\n# non-global animations are only available in the file\ncss @keyframes blink\n\t0% c:white\n\t100% c:blue\n```\n\n### Overriding animations in selector [preview=lg]\n\nOne improvement over standard css is that you can define keyframes inside other selectors, and thereby override default animations of the same name.\n\n```imba\n# We have a global blink animation\nglobal css @keyframes blink\n\t0% c:white\n\t100% c:blue\n# animate all links on hover\nglobal css a\n\td:block bg:gray2 rd:md m:2 p:2\n\t@hover animation: blink 2s\n\n# Override blink animation just inside #header .item\ncss #header a\n\t@keyframes blink\n\t\tfrom opacity:0\n\t\tto opacity:1\n\nimba.mount do <div[pos:absolute inset:0 d:flex ja:center]>\n\t<a> \"changing color\"\n\t<div#header> <a> \"fading\"\n```",

There is a case to be made against short variable names in programming, but css properties are never-changing. Imba provides intuitive abbreviations for oft-used css properties, as well as additional properties covering common usecases:</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{}\" data-path=\"/docs/style-syntax/3\"><code data-lang=\"imba\">css .btn\n    d:block pl:4px pr:4px bg:#b2f5ea\ncss .btn@hover\n    bg:#81e6d9</code></app-code-block><p>We also want to make it easy to follow a consistent design system throughout your project while not enforcing a predefined look and feel. Imba provides default (but configurable) colors, fonts, size units and more to help enforce consistency:</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{}\" data-path=\"/docs/style-syntax/4\"><code data-lang=\"imba\">css .btn\n    d:block px:1 bg:teal2\ncss .btn@hover\n    bg:teal3</code></app-code-block><p>Rules can also be written on a single line</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{}\" data-path=\"/docs/style-syntax/5\"><code data-lang=\"imba\">css .btn d:block px:1 bg:teal2\ncss .btn@hover bg:teal3</code></app-code-block><p>There are also some patterns that come up again and again in css. Changing a few properties on <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">hover</app-code-inline> or other states, or setting certain dimensions for specific screen sizes etc. Imba got you covered with property modifiers that we will get into later. But to round up, the first block of css here would usually be written like this in Imba:</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{}\" data-path=\"/docs/style-syntax/6\"><code data-lang=\"imba\">css .btn d:block px:1 bg:teal2 bg@hover:teal3</code></app-code-block><p>This conciseness comes especially handy when declaring inline styles, which we will come back to later.</p>"

Still, aiming to be the friendliest full-stack language we have included styling as a core part of the language. We've also extended the functionality of css to make common patterns friendlier, and to make it easier to keep a consistent design language across your whole project. Our approach to styling is inspired by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), so we recommend reading about [their philosophy](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first).\n\n```imba\ncss .btn\n\tdisplay: block\n\tbackground: #b2f5ea\n\tpadding-left: 4px\n\tpadding-right: 4px\n\ncss .btn@hover\n\tbackground: #81e6d9\n```\nAs you can see from the snippet above, the syntax of styles in imba are very similar to css, just without braces and semi-colon. At the same time, Imba includes powerful shorthands and [style modifiers](/docs/styles/modifiers) to allow the css above to be written like:\n\n```imba\ncss .btn d:block px:1 bg:teal2 bg@hover:teal3\n```\n\n\n## Further reading\n\n<doc-pages></doc-pages>\n",

          "body": "# Elements\n\nIn Imba, DOM elements are a first-class part of the language. Imba does not use a virtual DOM, instead it compiles declarative tag trees into an extremely efficient [memoized dom](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/the-virtual-dom-is-slow-meet-the-memoized-dom-bb19f546cc52), which is orders of magnitute faster than virtual DOM approaches, yet conceptually simpler.\n\n## Constructing Elements\n\n```imba\nlet div = <div#main.note.sticky title='Welcome'> 'Hello'\n```\n\nThe code above creates an actual HTMLDivElement. It will be helpful to understand what happens behind the scenes when creating an element using the literal syntax. Imba breaks up each part of the node, and applies them one after the other. The code above roughly compiles to:\n\n```imba\nlet div = document.createElement('div') # create div\ndiv.id = 'main' # set id\ndiv.classList.add('note') # add .note\ndiv.classList.add('sticky') # add .sticky\ndiv.title = 'Welcome' # set title\ndiv.textContent = 'Hello' # set textContent\n```\n\n## Setting Classes\n\nYou can add classes to your elements by adding one or more identifiers preceded by `.`\n\n```imba\n# add note and editorial classes\n<div.note.editorial> \"Hello\"\n```\n\nSet a class only when a certain condition is met can be done using `.class=condition`.\n\n```imba\n<div.note.editorial .resolved=data.isResolved> \"Hello\"\n```\n\nTo add dynamic classes based on data use `{}` for interpolation inside class names:\n\n```imba\nlet marks = 'rounded important'\nlet state = 'done'\nlet color = 'blue'\n# ---\n<div.item .{marks} .{state} .bg-{color}-200> \"Hello\"\n```\n\nThese interpolated classes can also be toggled by a condition:\n\n```imba\n<div.item .theme-{user.theme}=app.loggedIn> \"Hello\"\n```\n\nClasses are set and updated in an optimised way which means that updating the raw `el.className` or `el.classList` directly will yield unexpected results. When you want to add and remove classes directly from the elements outside of rendering trees you need to use `el.flags` which works just like [Element.classList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList).\n\n```imba\n# add example for el.flags here\n```\n\n## Setting Properties\n\nAs you've already seen you can add properties to the elements just like you would in HTML. You can set arbitrary properties on the elements. Just remember that you are setting properties, **not attributes**. They are for the most part mapped 1-to-1, but attributes like `tabindex` must be set using the `tabIndex` property.\n\n```imba\n<div lang=\"en\" title=data.title tabIndex=0> \"Hello\"\n```\n\nIn addition to all the regular properties supported in the JS DOM, Imba introduces a few special properties that are useful to know about:\n\n<api-list>Element.own.setters.custom</api-list>\n\n## Setting Attributes\n\nBy default you are setting properties on elements, NOT attributes. The reason `<div title='Hello'>` works is that Element.title is defined as an IDL property that proxies to `setAttribute('title',...)`. So setting `somename` on an element won't automatically show up as attributes on the element. To set raw custom attributes you can use the html namespace prefix:\n\n```imba\n<div somename='hello'> # sets property on div\n<div html:someproperty='hello'> # sets html attribute on div\n```\nYou can also declare attributes on your components using the `attr` keyword.\n```imba\ntag app-panel\n    attr desc\n```\nThen you can use `desc` as any other standard IDL property.\n```imba\n<app-panel desc=\"Some description\">\n```\n\n## Adding Inline Styles\nSee [Styling Documentation](/docs/css) for in-depth documentation about styling, both via selectors and inline on elements.\n\n```imba\n<div[color:red bg:blue padding:8px]> \"Hello\"\n```\n\nJust like classes, styles can be conditionally applied\n\n```imba\n<div[color:red bg:blue] [display:none]=app.loggedIn> \"Hello\"\n```\n\n## Adding Event Listeners\n\nWe can use `<tag @event=expression>` to listen to DOM events and run `expression` when they’re triggered. See [Events Documentation](/docs/events).\n\n```imba\nlet counter = 0\n<button @click=(counter++)> \"Increment to {counter + 1}\"\n```\n\n## Rendering Children\n\nIndentation is significant in Imba, and tags follow the same principles. We never explicitly close our tags. Instead, tags are closed implicitly by indentation. So, to add children to an element you simply indent them below:\n\n```imba\n<div> <ul>\n\t<li> <span> 'one'\n\t<li> <span> 'two'\n\t<li> <span> 'three'\n```\n\nTags can also be included inside string interpolations, so that templates like this:\n\n```imba\n<div>\n    \"This is \"\n    <b> \"very\"\n    \" important\"\n```\n\nCan be written like on a single line\n\n```imba\n<div> \"This is {<b> \"very\"} important\"\n```\n\nAlso, if you explicitly close your elements using `/>` at the end, you can add multiple elements after one another without problem:\n\n```imba\n<label> <input type='checkbox'/> 'Dark Mode'\n```\n\n## Conditionals & Loops\n\nThere isn't really a difference between templating syntax and other code in Imba. Tag trees are just code, so logic and control flow statements work as you would expect. To render dynamic lists of items you simply write a `for` loop where you want the children to be:\n\n```imba\n<div>\n    if items\n        <h1> \"List of items:\"\n        <ul> for item in items\n            <li> <span> item\n    else\n        <span> \"No items found\"\n```\n\nYou can use break, continue and other control flow concepts as well:\n\n```imba\n# ~preview=xl\nimport {movies} from 'imdb'\n\ncss .heading c:blue7 fs:xs fw:bold p:2 bc:gray3 bbw:1 pos:sticky t:0 bg:white\ncss .item mx:2 d:flex px:2 py:3 bc:gray2 bbw:1 bg.hover:gray1\ncss .title px:1 t:truncate\ncss .number rd:3 px:2 bg:blue2 mr:1 fs:xs c:blue7 d:grid pc:center\n\n# ---\nimba.mount do <div.list> for movie,i in movies\n    if i % 10 == 0\n        # Add a heading for every 10th item\n        <div.heading> \"{i + 1} to {i + 10}\"\n    <div.item>\n        <span.number> i + 1\n        <span.title> movie.title\n    # break out of the loop early\n    break if movie.title == 'The Usual Suspects'\n```\n\n## Dynamic Element Type [advanced]\n\nThe first part of your tag literal should be the node name. So, to create a section you write `<section>`, for a list item you write `<li>` and so forth. You can use `{}` interpolation in the node name to spawn custom tags:\n\n```imba\n# ~preview\nimport 'util/styles'\n# ---\nlet data = {type: 'button', label: 'Hello'}\nimba.mount do\n    <div.group>\n        <section> \"A section\"\n        <{data.type}> data.label\n```\n\nIf you create an element without a node name it will always be created as a `div`.\n\n## Fragments [advanced]\n\nFragments allow grouping elements together in a parent tag, without actually adding the parent tag to the DOM. Fragments can be created using empty tag literals `<>`.\n\n\n```imba fragment.imba\ntag app-dialog\n\tdef render\n\t\t<self>\n\t\t\t<header> \"Dialog header\"\n\t\t\t<.body> body!\n\n\tdef body\n\t\t<> # Returns all elements without any wrapping element\n\t\t\t<h3> \"Body text\"\n\t\t\t<p> \"With some adjecent content\"\n\n\t# Because imba returns the last statement\n    # this function would only return the <p> element\n\tdef bad-body\n\t\t<h3> \"Body text\"\n\t\t<p> \"With some adjecent content\"\n\n```",

Global Event Handlers [preview=md]\n\nIf your element needs to attach a global event handler, do it on the `<global>` tag. This is useful for things like keyboard shortcuts, or listening for mouse events that happen outside of the element. Event listeners on the `<global>` tag will be removed when the element is unmounted.\n\nThere is an event modifier called `outside` that can be used in conjunction with mouse events on the global tag. This will limit the event to firing when it happens outside of the element. It's demonstrated below.\n\n```imba\nimport 'util/styles'\n\n# ---\ntag my-menu\n\tcss .menu-container shadow:0 0 0 1px black/10, lg rd:5px mt:5px o:0 ml:10px of:hidden tween:all 300ms ease\n\t\t.menu-item p:5px 10px bdb:1px solid cooler2 @last:none bgc:white @hover: blue5 c:gray8 @hover:white cursor:pointer\n\n\tshowMenu = false\n\n\t<self>\n\n\t\t<global\n\t\t\t@click.outside=(showMenu = false)\n\t\t\t@keydown=(showMenu = false if e.key === 'Escape')\n\t\t>\n\n\t\t<div[d:flex]>\n\t\t\t<button @click=(showMenu = !showMenu)> \"Toggle Menu\"\n\t\t\t<div.menu-container [opacity:1]=showMenu>\n\t\t\t\t<div.menu-item> \"Click Outside\"\n\t\t\t\t<div.menu-item> \"Or Press Escape\"\n# ---\n\nimba.mount <my-menu>\n```\n\n#### 2. Appending to Body [preview=md]\n\nContent nested within the `<global>` tag will be appended to the document's `<body>`. You can think of it like a slot, or portal. This can be useful for things such as modal windows with should appear above everything else.\n\nWhen your element unmounts, content added to `<global>` will also be unmounted.\n\n```imba\nimport 'util/styles'\n\n# ---\ntag my-menu\n\n\tcss .modal-window zi:10 c:white pos:absolute t:50% l:50% x:-50% y:-50% bgc:black/70 p:30px rd:10px\n\n\tshowModal = false\n\n\t<self>\n\t\t<button @click=(showModal = !showModal)> \"Toggle Modal\"\n\t\t<global>\n\t\t\tif showModal\n\t\t\t\t<div.modal-window @click=(showModal = false)>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1> \"This is appended to the body tag\"\n\n# ---\n\nimba.mount <my-menu>\n```",

If you set an `ease` attribute on a tag, ie. `<my-element ease>`, imba makes it possible to easily style the enter-state and exit-state of the element and its children, as well as the timing and easing of this transition.\n\nImba does not ship with any prebuilt transitions. This might change in a later version, but the idea is that the syntax for styling is powerful enough to easily create your own transitions. \n\n\n```imba\n# ~preview=md\nimport 'util/styles'\n\ncss label d:hflex a:center us:none\ncss input mx:1\n\n# ---\ntag App\n    alerted = no\n    <self @click=(alerted = !alerted)>\n        if alerted\n            <div.alert> \"Important message\"\n# ---\nlet app = imba.mount <App.clickable>\n```\n\nIn the above example, we attach the `<div>` to the dom only when `alerted` is true. In many cases you may want to smoothly transition the element in and out instead of abruptly removing it. To do this in imba, we simply add an `ease` property to the `<div>` in question.\n\n```imba\n# ~preview=md\n# css div p:2 m:2 overflow:hidden min-width:80px\nimport 'util/styles'\n# ---\ntag App\n    alerted = no\n    <self @click=(alerted = !alerted)>\n        if alerted\n            <div.alert[opacity@off:0] ease> \"Important message\"\n# ---\nlet app = imba.mount <App.clickable>\n```\n\nNow that we have declared that this element should ease, we use the `@off` style modifier to specify the appearance of the element when it is detached from the dom. In this case, we set that the opacity should be set to 0. Imba will transition to/from `@off` state smoothly, but all easings and durations can be customized. Imba takes care of keeping the element attached to the dom until all transitions have finished.\n\nIf you want separate transitions depending on whether the element is being attached or detached, you can use the `@in` and `@out` modifiers:\n\n\n\n```imba\n# ~preview=md\n# css div p:2 m:2 overflow:hidden min-width:80px\nimport 'util/styles'\n\n# ---\ntag App\n    alerted = no\n    <self @click=(alerted = !alerted)>\n        if alerted\n            <div.alert[y@in:100px y@out:-100px] ease> \"In from below, out above!\"\n# ---\nlet app = imba.mount <App.clickable>\n```\nNow you can see that it comes in from the left, but leaves to the right. If the element is re-attached while exiting or detached while still entering, the transition will gracefully revert. You can see this by clicking the checkbox rapidly.\n\nYou can easily transition nested elements inside the eased element as well.\n\n```imba\n# ~preview=md\n# css div p:2 m:2 overflow:hidden min-width:80px\nimport 'util/styles'\n# ---\ntag App\n    alerted = no\n    <self @click=(alerted = !alerted)>\n        if alerted\n            <div.alert[o@off:0 y@off:100px ease:1s] ease>\n                <div[scale@off:0]> \"Important message\"\n# ---\nlet app = imba.mount <App.clickable>\n```\n\nClick to see the inner div scale during the transition. Also note that we did set the duration of the transition using the `ease` style property. You can specify the ease duration and timing function for each element, and also specify them individually for transforms, opacity and colors. See properties.\n",

To do this in imba, we simply add an <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">ease</app-code-inline> property to the <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">&lt;div&gt;</app-code-inline> in question.</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{&quot;preview&quot;:&quot;md&quot;}\" data-path=\"/docs/transitions/2\"><code data-lang=\"imba\"># ~preview=md\n# css div p:2 m:2 overflow:hidden min-width:80px\nimport 'util/styles'\n# ---\ntag App\n    alerted = no\n    &lt;self @click=(alerted = !alerted)&gt;\n        if alerted\n            &lt;div.alert[opacity@off:0] ease&gt; \"Important message\"\n# ---\nlet app = imba.mount &lt;App.clickable&gt;</code></app-code-block><p>Now that we have declared that this element should ease, we use the <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">@off</app-code-inline> style modifier to specify the appearance of the element when it is detached from the dom. In this case, we set that the opacity should be set to 0. Imba will transition to/from <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">@off</app-code-inline> state smoothly, but all easings and durations can be customized. Imba takes care of keeping the element attached to the dom until all transitions have finished.</p><p>If you want separate transitions depending on whether the element is being attached or detached, you can use the <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">@in</app-code-inline> and <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">@out</app-code-inline> modifiers:</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{&quot;preview&quot;:&quot;md&quot;}\" data-path=\"/docs/transitions/3\"><code data-lang=\"imba\"># ~preview=md\n# css div p:2 m:2 overflow:hidden min-width:80px\nimport 'util/styles'\n\n# ---\ntag App\n    alerted = no\n    &lt;self @click=(alerted = !alerted)&gt;\n        if alerted\n            &lt;div.alert[y@in:100px y@out:-100px] ease&gt; \"In from below, out above!\"\n# ---\nlet app = imba.mount &lt;App.clickable&gt;</code></app-code-block><p>Now you can see that it comes in from the left, but leaves to the right. If the element is re-attached while exiting or detached while still entering, the transition will gracefully revert. You can see this by clicking the checkbox rapidly.</p><p>You can easily transition nested elements inside the eased element as well.</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{&quot;preview&quot;:&quot;md&quot;}\" data-path=\"/docs/transitions/4\"><code data-lang=\"imba\"># ~preview=md\n# css div p:2 m:2 overflow:hidden min-width:80px\nimport 'util/styles'\n# ---\ntag App\n    alerted = no\n    &lt;self @click=(alerted = !alerted)&gt;\n        if alerted\n            &lt;div.alert[o@off:0 y@off:100px ease:1s] ease&gt;\n                &lt;div[scale@off:0]&gt; \"Important message\"\n# ---\nlet app = imba.mount &lt;App.clickable&gt;</code></app-code-block><p>Click to see the inner div scale during the transition. Also note that we did set the duration of the transition using the <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">ease</app-code-inline> style property. You can specify the ease duration and timing function for each element, and also specify them individually for transforms, opacity and colors. See properties.</p>"

Unlike javascript, multiple declarations per line is not allowed.\n\n```imba\n# readonly constant\nconst one = 123\n\n# single declaration\nlet a = 123\n\n# array destructuring\nlet [e,f,...rest] = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\n# object destructuring\nlet {g,h,data:i} = {g:1,h:2,data:3}\n\n# in conditionals\nif let user = array.find(do $1 isa Person)\n\tyes\n```\n\n> [tip box yellow] In all the examples throughout this documentation you can hover over an identifier to highlight all references to the variable. Identifiers resolving to variables have a different color than identifiers resolving as implicit accessors of self.\n\n## Implicit Self\n\nAny identifier starting with a lowercase letter or `$` that is not previusly declared will be treated as an accessor on `self`. This is a crucial concept to understand, especially when coming from JavaScript, where any undeclared variable implicitly refers to the global scope.\n\n```imba\nlet declared = yes\ndeclared # => yes\nundeclared # => the same as this.undeclared\n```\n\nAs you can see from the examples in this documentation, implicit accessors and resolved variables are highlighted with different colors. This type of semantic highlighting is also supported in the [vscode tooling](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scrimba.vsimba).\n\n```imba\nconst scale = 1\n\nclass Rectangle\n    def check forced\n        forced # found variable named arg - no implicit self\n        scale # resolves to variable declared in root\n        width # implicit self (no variable named width)\n        self.width # explicit self\n```\n\nIf this concept feels strange and unknown, feel free to explicitly use `self.` as you would in js.\n\n> [tip] Uppercased identifiers are not treated as accessors. So `Array`, `Map`, or `SomeIdentifier` will always resolve the same way they do in JavaScript.\n\nVariables are _not_ hoisted in Imba. This means that a reference to a variable before its declaration will behave is if there is no declaration - and instead be an implicit access on self.\n\n```imba\ndef method\n\tdata # not in scope - same as self.data\n\tlet data = {a:1,b:2}\n\tdata # in scope\n```\n\n## Global variables\n\nIn addition to identifiers starting with an uppercase letter, there are a few global variables that are always resolved.\n\n<api-list>imba.Globals.own.properties</api-list>\n<api-list>imba.Globals.own.methods</api-list>\n\nThese identifiers will **not** use implicit self, since they are resolved as global variables. This means that if you have an object with a property `window` or a method named `setTimeout`, you will need to use `self.` when referencing them.\n\n```imba\nclass Loader\n    prop window\n\n    def setup\n        window # Ooops, reference to the global window\n        self.window # Pheew, reference to Loader.window\n```\n\n## Block Scopes\n\n`if`, `elif`, `else`, `do`, `for`,`while`,`until`,`switch`,`do` create block scopes. This means that any variable declared in the indented code inside these statements are only available within that scope.\n\n```imba\n# global scope\nlet x = 1\nif true\n\t# block scope\n\tlet y = 2\ny # not a variable in scope\n```\n\n## This vs Self\n\nIf you come from js, `this` will be a well-known concept. While `this` still exists, working exactly like its js counterpart, `self` is what you should use in imba. It is a very common pattern in js to need to refer to an outer scope when dealing with callbacks, event listeners and more.\n\n```javascript\nsetup(){\n\tvar self = this;\n\t[1,2,3].map(function(){\n\t\tself.doSomething();\n\t})\n}\n```\n\nThis is essentially what `self` does under the hood. In imba, `self` is bound do the closest _selfish_ scope. Besides the root scope of a file, only the scopes of `def`, `get` and `set` are selfish.\n\n```imba\nclass Item\n\tdef setup\n\t\t# selfish scope\n\t\t[1,2,3].map do |val|\n\t\t\t# selfless scope\n\t\t\tself # the Item\n\t\t\tthis # the array\n```\n\nIf this looks confusing, fear not – `this` is something you will practically never see or use in imba codebases.",

Behind the scenes it uses the [mousetrap.js](https://craig.is/killing/mice) library. See the [@hotkey](/api/Element/@hotkey) documentation.\n\nLet's say we have a button that plays/pauses a video whenever it is clicked.\n```imba\n<button @click=togglePlayback> \"Play/pause\"\n```\nIf we want to allow users to toggle playback using the spacebar, we can simply add a hotkey listener and pass in the keycombo we want it to respond to.\n```imba\n<button @hotkey('space') @click=togglePlayback> \"Play/pause\"\n```\nWhen a hotkey listener does not have a handler, it defaults to executing a click on the element. So this should be enough to allow playing/pausing by pressing the spacebar.\n\nA hotkey will be active as long as the element with the listener is attached to the document. This makes it very easy to conditionally enable certain hotkeys in a declarative manner.\n\n```imba\ntag App\n    <self>\n        if let item = state.selection\n            <div[d:none]\n                @hotkey('del')=deleteItem(item)\n                @hotkey('enter')=editItem(item)\n                @hotkey('esc')=(state.selection = null)\n            >\n```\nIn the example above we add a hidden div to the dom if there is a selItem, and add three hotkey handlers to this element. So, whenever `app.selItem` is set, pressing `enter` will trigger the `editItem(selItem)` handler.\n\nFor hotkey groups and disabling/enable all hotkeys within a certain dom tree see the [Element.hotkeys](/api/Element/hotkeys) property.",

But if you click a movie-item 10 times, the <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">movie-card.data</app-code-inline> property will be set 10 times.

Then we can set the color scale using the <app-code-inline class=\"code code-inline light\" data-lang=\"imba\">hue</app-code-inline> property.</p><app-code-block class=\"code code-block\" data-meta=\"{&quot;preview&quot;:&quot;md&quot;}\" data-path=\"/reference/8\"><code data-lang=\"imba\"># [preview=md]\nimport 'util/styles'\nglobal css body d:hflex ja:center inset:0\n# ---\ntag Button\n    css px:4 py:2 rd:md cursor:pointer c:white\n        text-shadow:0px 1px hue8/70\n        bg:hue5 @hover:hue6\n        bd:1px solid hue6\n\n    &lt;self&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;slot&gt;\n\nimba.mount do &lt;&gt;\n    &lt;Button[hue:blue]&gt; \"Button\"\n    &lt;Button[hue:red]&gt; \"Button\"\n    &lt;Button[hue:green]&gt; \"Button\"\n    &lt;Button[hue:amber hue@hover:purple]&gt; \"Hover me\"</code></app-code-block>"
