# Colors

[demo](/examples/css/colors.imba?preview=styles)

The color CSS data-type represents a color in the sRGB color space. Colors can be defined in all the same ways as in plain css. In addition, imba as built-in support for named colors hand-crafted by the great people behind [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). All named colors come in 10 different shades, named from `color0` up to `color9`. You can hover over each color below to see their name:

Just like other colors like `#7A4ACF`, `hsl(120,90%,45%)`, `rgba(120,255,176)`, these named colors can be used anywhere in your styles where a color value is expected.
