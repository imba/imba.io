# Style Properties

Imba supports all regular css properties. For a full reference on all css properties we recommend visiting the MDN docs. There are some custom properties and shorthands added in Imba that are very valuable. There are also a configurable design system (inpsired by Tailwind) built in. Among other things, this features non-standard values for [display](css), [box-shadow](css), [border-radius](css), [transition-timing-function](css), as well as [color](css) palettes. The custom [hue](css) property is especially useful..
