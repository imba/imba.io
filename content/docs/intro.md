## Build Fast, Fast.

Imba is a Web programming language that compiles to Javascript. Imba is fast in two ways: Time-saving syntax with built-in tags and styles results in less typing and switching files so you can build things fast. A groundbreaking memoized DOM is an order of magnitude faster than virtual DOM libraries, so you can build fast things.

In Imba DOM elements _and_ CSS are treated as first-class citizens. DOM elements are compiled to a [memoized DOM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-virtual-dom-is-slow-meet-the-memoized-dom-bb19f546cc52/), which is an [order of magnitude faster](https://somebee.github.io/dom-reconciler-bench/index.html) than today's virtual DOM implementations.

## Getting Started

### Quickstart

The best way to get started with Imba is to use `npx` to get a brand-new project up and running.

```sh
npx imba create my-app
```

Follow the instructions to complete the fresh install.

### Full example

```sh
npx imba create my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will create a brand new app using the latest version of Imba and run it with hot reloading. Edit the `/app/client.imba` file to get started.

To create a build version of the app for deployment, simply run:

```sh
npm build
```

### Useful tools

We thoroughly recommend using our Visual Studio Code integration which has fantastic tooling when using Imba - including autocomplete for css shortcuts.
