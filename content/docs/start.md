# Quick Start

The easiest way to get started with Imba is to use `npx` to get a brand-new project up and running. You can also try Imba immediately in your browser with the [Imba playground](/try/examples/apps/playground/app.imba)

### Create a starter project

Enter this command in your terminal, then follow the prompts to create a starter app.

```sh
npx imba create my-app
```

This will create a brand new app using the latest version of Imba. Run the hot reloading server with `npm run dev` inside the project directory. Edit the `/app/client.imba` file to get started on your project.

### Build for deployment

To build your app for deployment, run this command from within your project folder:

```sh
npm run build
```

### Imba VSCode Plugin

Imba's Visual Studio Code integration is highly recommended. The extension gives you full-featured tooling when using Imba, including autocomplete for css shortcuts.
