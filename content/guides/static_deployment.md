# Static Deployment

Imba runs on the server and the client. This guide is for client-only deployment. If what you need is a full stack site, with both a client and server, see the [full stack deployment guide](full_stack_deployment).

_These instructions assume you are using our [imba-vite-template](https://github.com/imba/imba-vite-template). Not all static site hosts are ready for Node v18, **we recommend Node v16 for static sites**._

Imba transpiles to JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Using Vite as its bundler means you can follow [Vite's deploy instructions](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html).

For example, you can deploy it to these (and more!) static site hosts:

- [Deploy Vite sites to Netlify](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#netlify).
- [Deploy Vite sites to GitHub Pages](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages).
- [Deploy Vite sites to CloudFlare Pages](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#cloudflare-pages).
- [Deploy Vite sites to Vercel](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#vercel).
