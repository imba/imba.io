# Create complex web apps with ease!

Imba was born to make developing web applications fun again. It features a clean and readable syntax inspired by ruby, compiles to readable and performant JavaScript, and works inside the existing ecosystem.

Imba treats DOM elements as a first-class citizens. Your declarative views are compiled to a [memoized dom](/guides/advanced/performance), which is an [order of magnitude faster](https://somebee.github.io/dom-reconciler-bench/index.html) than todays virtual dom implementations. We truly believe that it opens up for a new way of developing web applications.
