# Development

The Imba compiler is itself written in Imba, using a custom version of the [Jison parser generator](https://github.com/zaach/jison). The command-line version of imba is available as a node.js utility. The compiler itself does not depend on Node, and can be run in any JavaScript environment, or in the browser.

Make sure you have the following tools installed

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).

All the code for the language is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/imba/imba)

```bash
# use https
git clone https://github.com/imba/imba.io
# or ssh
git@github.com:imba/imba.io.git
cd imba
yarn # npm install
```

## Making Changes

If you are going to fix a new bug or add enhancement, please make sure to update the test suite with cases covering your code. Depending on your changes you might just need to expand one of the [existing tests](https://github.com/imba/imba/tree/master/test). If you need to create a whole new test take a look at the [test/index.imba](https://github.com/imba/imba/blob/master/test/index.imba).

## Running the Tests

There are several scripts for running the tests. The CI will run all of them but you can save yourselves some cycles by running them locally and fixing it all up before opening a pull request.

## Test Imba

```bash
yarn run test # npm run test
```

## Imbapack and Webpack Tests

```bash
yarn run test-webpack # npm run test-webpack
```

## Google Chrome Tests via Puppeteer

```bash
yarn run test-chrome # npm run test-chrome
```
