# Release

There is currently no official release schedule for the Imba project. If a critical bug has been found that will warrant a new release, but this will likely change with a formal release schedule when development activity is back up.

The rest of this page serves as a checklist for the release manager.

## Checklist

- [ ] Verify your current version before bumping `npm version`.

If the version looks correct you can proceed by bumping the patch version

- [ ] `npm version patch`, if you want to change the other versions the available options are (`major`, `minor`)
- [ ] Verify the version looks good by running `npm version` and with git `git tag`.

If both look good you can proceed by pushing your changes to GitHub

- [ ] `git push origin master && git push origin --tags`
- [ ] Create release notes that are basically a summary of the output in `git log 1.4.3..v1.4.7`
- [ ] Use those release notes on the GitHub releases page.
- [ ] Then finally publish to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imba) by running `npm publish`
- [ ] Make a tweet on the @imbajs account
