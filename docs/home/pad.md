# What is Imba?
Imba is a programming language for the web that compiles to performant and readable JavaScript. It is specifically designed to improve the way we create rich site and applications. It has language level support for defining, extending, subclassing, instantiating and rendering dom nodes. For a semi-complex application like TodoMVC, it is more than 10 times faster than React with less code, and a much smaller library.

# Optimized for

## Developers
Rather than being an academic exercise, Imba has been developed over several years, alongside actual applications. Imba has been fine-tuned to ease the challenges we face when developing rich, dynamic apps (and sites).

## Interoperability
Imba compiles down to clean and readable JavaScript. Your formatting, indentaiton, and comments are included. You can use any existing JavaScript library seamlessly from Imba, and vica-versa.

## Speed
You can use all the syntactic sugar in Imba without needing to worry about the performance and readability of the compiled code, and building your views using Imba's native support for tags results in unprecedented performance. 

## Performance
Rendering views using Imba's language level support for tags compiles to *extremely* performant code. In pure synchronous rendering of an application like TodoMVC, Imba beats all existing implementations by an **order of magnitude**.
